    "content": "I didn't have any posts in August and September due to the volume of travel I had for work. Now I'm trying to ease back into writing here with a few shorter posts I have planned to round out the year, but I also have several drafts for longer posts in my \"Knowing\" series that I hope to finish and publish sometime in the next six months or so.\nWhen I was growing up, we regularly visited my grandparents farm. They had a stream flowing through their property, and for many years there were beavers making their home at a certain bend in the stream. It wasn't far from the farmhouse–a ten-minute walk perhaps–but it was out of sight, beyond the pastures and through the woods a bit. So it felt like a mini-adventure to go see the beaver pond, often accompanied by an aunt. I don't recall if we ever managed to see the beavers themselves there–although I've since spotted some many times out paddling or hiking in various places–but their handiwork was everywhere: chomp-marked stumps and felled logs, the dam, the lodge, dug-out channels. Very clever and industrious little creatures, and I've admired them ever since.\nThis summer we got the outside of our house refreshed with a new paint job, including the doors. To complete the look I wanted and to add a unique touch, I had the idea to install a door-knocker. The traditional animal for such things is the lion, but I thought that an animal that I feel some affinity for would give it more of a personal flavour; plus, beavers use their tails to make an audible alert, which seemed very fitting for a door-knocker.\nA Google Image Search helped me find something that matched what I was envisioning. This was from an eBay store by a West Coast artist named Mary Ann Dabritz. I'm very pleased with how it looks on my door:\nSeparately from shopping for cast brass hardware, I've been getting into some metal-casting channels on YouTube. I enjoy seeing how things are made and the skill and creativity people bring to their crafts. The following video is a great example; I appreciate how this artisan incorporates 3d-printing into his workflow (which is the avenue by which I found his channel initially):\nAnother great instance of beaver-related art that I've encountered this year is a children's book called What Goes On Inside a Beaver Pond? This describes the activities that beavers (and other wetland species) do throughout the course of a year. It is set in the Pleasant Valley wildlife sanctuary in Western Massachusetts. I've previously noted that illustration quality is a key factor in the appeal of children's books, and good illustrations are also extremely helpful for any kind of guidebook about the natural world. The illustrator of this work, Carrie Shryock, did a great job on both of those levels. Here's a couple of pages as an example:\nFor adults interested in beavers, I can recommend that book Eager by Ben Goldfarb, which I've reviewed before.\n2025 has been a notable year for beaver-related history. It marks the end, after 355 years, of the Hudson's Bay Company. It made a fortune off of beaver pelts and had vast territorial holdings before its more recent embodiment as a department store.\nI'll wrap this post up with one more piece of beaver art. One of the places I was travelling for my job this summer was Clinton, Iowa. The downtown there wasn't much (although it did have a couple of good large antique stores), but it had some nice sculptures of Mississippi wildlife, including this one of a beaver:\nPermalink",

    "description": "In an information environment that is somewhere between actively hostile to indifferent to providing you with knowledge that is true and useful, you have to take a defensive posture.",
    "content": "This is the first post in my new series/theme about knowledge, knowledge management, and related topics.\nIn my previous post, I introduced the new reading and writing theme that I'm taking on over the coming year-ish. I've already read a couple of books related to this theme (Knowing What We Know by Simon Winchester and We Have No Idea by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whitesun). This post is the first of around half a dozen that I have planned for the new series. In it, I want to provide motivation for engaging with the rest of the series; basically, what can be some of the practical benefits of reflecting on how we know things and what we can do with knowledge? Well, as I tried to make clear in the segue from the Industry series to this one, acquiring, disseminating, and applying knowledge is integral in our ability to make stuff. This is true not only at the individual level but at the societal level too: from patents to periodicals, there's a lot of social technology aimed at promoting knowledge transfer. In this post, I aim to explore some other practical considerations around Knowing: ways to learn things, the current information landscape that we have to deal with, and how to keep track of knowledge.\nWithin each section below, you'll find some brainstorming on these practical aspects of Knowing. This is the beginning of exploring this topic, not the last word. I hope it sparks some helpful ideas of your own, and illustrates why I felt like this was a worthwhile and timely theme to take on.\nThis series is about taking a deliberate approach to how we think about knowledge. Something that is very empowering as an adult who is no longer in formal education (modulo workplace trainings and maybe an occasional conference) is taking a deliberate approach to learning. Therefore learning seems like a great place to start this post.\nWhen setting out to learn something, you should consider what kinds of information are available about it, as well as what is your most effective learning style (visual, auditory/verbal, hands-on) for that sort of thing.\nReading is often a good place to start, because there's more information available (and findable in a search) in written form than pretty much any other format. A lecture or demonstration might be better but those are few and far between compared to books and blogs and such. Not only books: browsing a magazine or forum can be a great starting point for getting into new hobbies. While reading about a subject, if a source gets mentioned in multiple things you read, try to read it too. You also shouldn't rely on just one book/source; consulting a few different ones can give you a sense of the points of agreement and active debate within a field.\nHere are a couple of Tweets that I think are insightful about \"doing the reading\":\nOne thing that has become very useful for learning things (especially skills with a physical component) in recent years is YouTube. Samo Burja (I'm working on a post about his ideas as part of this series, by the way) has a good article about this:\nAnother approach to learning new skills is simply to pick an entry-level project and dive in. You'll make mistakes, for sure, but when you consult videos or books later on for advice, the instructions will make a lot more sense because you'll be able to relate them to personal experience. This is the approach I took when trying to learn how to use fibreglass, for example. Another way to provide conceptual anchors for learning things is by travelling, as Tyler Cowen has pointed out.\nGetting into more formal and higher-effort forms of learning, you can try attending lectures and presentations about the topic of interest. Or seek out mentoring/apprenticeship relationships. Discussion groups (ideally in-person, but online can be an option too) are pretty great too. The famous Oxford Tutorial is a time-tested format for high-quality education and it incorporates these features:\nFinally, it's frequently remarked that one of the best ways to really learn something is to teach it to someone else. Closely related to this is writing about it. Paul Graham has an essay expressing concern that the rise of LLMs will lead to fewer people writing; he sees writing as being intricately connected to thinking deeply and clearly:\nCertainly one of my major reasons for blogging is that I see this benefit. Writing helps me learn about and think through various topics I'm interested in.\nThere are two features of the current information landscape that I want to draw your attention to. The first is the sheer volume of information we have access to. An unprecedented firehose at our finger-tips of facts, claims, trivia, news, debate, and entertainment; text, pictures, audio, video. The second is that almost all of this content comes from sources and/or across channels that are out to get you—they want your attention, your engagement, to get you to buy something or at least watch an ad, to recruit you to their ideology, to turn you into a vector for their ideas. This is not unprecedented; there's a long history of newspapers having political alignments or even affiliations and of authors writing books and articles to persuade not merely inform—I wouldn't even call this sort of thing illegitimate. However, because of the first feature, this is all happening at a very large scale. And with very efficient tools and often without deliberate human action (e.g. automated A/B testing and algorithmic fine-tuning of feeds that often doesn't care about the actual content, just about optimizing certain engagement metrics).\n(When you read my blog, am I out to get you? Well, as described in the other sections of this post, writing a blog is part of my process for learning and for knowledge management, so I'm doing it in part out of a personal motivation and having readers is a bonus. I don't monetize this blog in any way: not ads, nor subscribers, nor affiliate links. But I do hope my writing is persuasive about things I believe and perspectives I hold, along with being informative, of course. So you shouldn't accept everything you read here uncritically, but you should be able to expect it to be free of clickbait and AI slop.)\nIn an information environment that is somewhere between actively hostile to indifferent to providing you with knowledge that is true and useful, you have to take a defensive posture. But I believe you still can extract signal from the noise. In this section I'll share some ideas on how to do so (both of my own and links to advice that I've come across) along with discussion and examples. I believe this is one of the crucial issues of our day.\nFirst, the firehose. This video about what it would take to print out Wikipedia is a good illustration:\nSome pages on Wikipedia that are good examples of the vastness of information that is readily accessible to us now are the Outline of Knowledge and List of Lists of Lists. And of course Wikipedia is just one website; there are plenty of other sources of information both online and offline. One that has exploded in popularity over the past few years is generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs). People are increasingly getting their information from LLMs. This is very much in my mind as I write this series. LLMs aren't a bad source of information, but they represent a big change and need to be used with an awareness of their strengths and weaknesses.\nIt's still early days for this new technology and I don't think anyone really knows the full impact it will have on our relationship with information and on society more broadly. Revolutions in communication technologies can have a huge impact, so generative AI could plausibly be as much of a disruption to the status quo as the printing press or television. Here are a few things I think we should watch out for:\nAside from the new element of LLMs, another notable feature of the current information landscape is that it exists in the context of a very polarized political landscape. So what are some good strategies for gleaning true and useful information from media that is trying hard to score points for their side?\nI think this article about Bounded Distrust and a series of responses and follow-ups (and responses to follow-ups) to it are a good place to start. The core idea—with debate on how to operationalize it and on where the lines now are—is that while most of the media is trying to push a narrative, they still play by rules. If you have a good sense of what those rules are, you can still learn something from biased news stories.\nAs the third article linked in the previous paragraph clarifies,\nThe general approach is that things can be slanted or framed in a misleading way, but statements that can be checked won't be bald-faced lies. For example, a common phrasing like \"an anonymous source claimed {X}\" means that someone said {X} but is indifferent as to whether {X} is true. An attributed quotation is better, in that there's someone who can publicly confirm or deny whether they said it, but still can't be taken to the bank as to whether the contents of the quotation are true; journalists have a lot of degrees of freedom in composing their stories, and who they share quotes from is an important one. Basic objective details, however (who, what, where, when) have much less wiggle-room. There's famously two (or more!) sides to each story. The distrust part of \"bounded distrust\" means that you don't have to accept the side that a news article subtly (or not so subtly) promotes in how they present it; the bounded part of \"bounded distrust\" means that the event in question probably did happen and did involve any named individuals.\nHere are some other heuristics that I try to use:\nAnother useful tool for making sense of a firehouse of information of varying levels of reliability/truthfulness is keeping track of predictions. Someone who is consistently wrong in their predictions or badly wrong on important questions either doesn't have good sources of information themselves, or has decided to be a poor source of information for you. Applying this in a practical way has quite a lag period, but it's better than nothing. One example that's still a work in progress is pundits who've said that if Trump won the election it would be the end of American democracy. If elections in 2026 and 2028 occur normally, you should take these people less seriously in the future; conversely, if those elections are cancelled or have a lot of irregularities, you should take them more seriously.\nHere's another example (I had originally written this as a forum post, but I think it's a good example of checking how predictions panned out and judging the credibility of the source based on that): Back in 2020 I was staying in an AirBnB in Nova Scotia and there were some books there for guests to read. One of them was The Maritime Book of Climate Change, by Richard Zurawski. It was published in 2008, and made some predictions for 10 years, 25 years, and more distant times in the future. Since the first milestone has already passed (and we're 2/3rds of the way to the second), I thought it would be handy to see how the predictions panned out. The author considered two scenarios: Good and Bad/Ugly. In the  good scenario, he expected that CO2 would have risen to 430 ppm by 2018, and that the sea level would have risen by 12 to 18 cm. The rate of ice melting in Greenland would have risen to 1,000 cubic km annually (quintupled from its 2008 rate) and the northeastern seaboard of North America would be, paradoxically, cooling as the Gulf Stream grew sluggish. He also makes qualitative predictions, like more frequent forest fires and pressure to accept climate refugees. 25 years out (i.e. 2033), but still in the Good scenario, he predicts the sea level will have risen 30 - 60 cm and, \"Charlottetown and other cities with softer, low-incline shores, have now introduced a policy of resettlement.\" Also, atmospheric CO2 is now at 750 ppm under this scenario. In the Bad/Ugly scenario, the author thought 2018 CO2 levels would have reached 450 ppm and the ocean would have risen 30 cm from 2008 levels. Outside of eastern Canada, the Great Lakes region would be baking and the Great Lakes would be at their lowest levels in recorded history. In 2033 in the Bad/Ugly scenario, there are 10 billion people in the world and conflict over diminishing resources is intensifying. Russia has the rest of Europe at its mercy due to their dependence on it for food and energy. The global average temperature has risen 5 degrees Celsius and geoengineering is starting to look pretty good. So what actually happened in 2018? Atmospheric CO2 levels were at 408 ppm and the sea level in the Maritimes was around 10 cm higher (based on the Bedford NS gauge). The latest numbers (with 2033 less than a decade away) are 421 ppm (as of 2023) and around a 15 cm sea level increase (as of 2024). I haven't checked how typical Mr. Zurawski's predictions from 2008 were. He did state that he believed the IPCC report was watered down due to political pressure, though I don't think he would have been alone in that view in the discourse of the time. But doing this exercise makes people with less alarmist views look like they're more worth listening to going forward.\nFollowing AI and extracting useful information from biased media, I want to discuss misinformation and censorship. I'll start with a couple of examples from abroad.\nThe first one is \"Baghdad Bob\" proclaiming Iraqi victories, except they occurred ever closer to the heart of Baghdad. You can see that censorship leads to worse decision-making (emphasis added):\nIn China, they apparently have internal reports called neican/NAY-tsahn in an effort to keep the leadership better informed than citizens. However, a culture of censorship leads to even the internal party communication channels becoming filled with yes-men and no longer as informative:\nTo continue on the discussion of misinformation and censorship, I'll share something I wrote on Facebook (lightly edited here):\nI have a few more assorted thoughts to close out this section. These aren't a conclusion, as this series is just getting started and I expect to think and write more on this important theme.\nFinally, there are times when you just have to accept that you'll have a fuzzy knowledge (at best!) of what's going on. When it's about things that you don't have to make any decisions about, this is fine. The nice thing is that your ability to cross-check/verify new information is strongest in issues or events that are closest to you. So focus on the integrity of information that affects decisions you need to make, and worry less about the rest. For instance, you'll never know what's going on in a war on another continent where you don't speak the language of any of the belligerents with the same clarity that you can—with a little effort—know about the outcome of a bylaw vote in your own city. And that's okay. The latter is something that will probably affect your life more, and is certainly more within your ability to influence. For things that are far away and that you can't affect the outcome of one whit nor even really validate the truth of what you're hearing, I think it's healthy to hold your opinions with low or moderate confidence.\nAfter you've managed to acquire knowledge, sifting through the chaff in the current information landscape along the way, you next need a way to keep track of it so you can retrieve or apply it as needed.\nI've started using personal knowledge management (PKM) software, OneNote at work and Obsidian at home. I haven't yet gotten to the point of having copious links between notes, which is supposed to be where these tools really shine. But even having your notes be searchable so easily is helpful. Of course, writing a blog has a lot of these features too. I have frequently gone back to old blog posts when I'm trying to remember a good quote from a book I've read or find some estimates from Vaclav Smil for some back of the envelope calculations.\nOffline, there are also lots of ways to keep track of knowledge and ideas. Personally, I keep notes in several different ways; it would be more organized if I had a single unified system, but it takes a lot of discipline and mental overhead to set something like that up and stick with it, and the sort-search tradeoff discussed below suggests that striving for perfect organization can be overkill. My mix looks something like this:\nThese paper-based methods of knowledge management have some different strengths and weaknesses compared to digital ones. I find things like hand writing and sticky tabs at a certain place in a book (that itself sits at a certain place on your bookshelf) stick in your memory better. Digital notes have the advantage that they can be searched more easily, and can also have relevant segments copied with ease into something you're writing. They can also be filed (or tagged, or linked) in more than one place.\nWhile I find highlights in ebooks and notes that are in a text file or PKM software are more streamlined with my writing workflow, there's definitely an aesthetic appeal to knowledge management from the physical organization of a home bookshelf/library. This video has a really nice example:\nIn our modern world that is going more and more digital, I find it enlightening to think about older ways of organizing knowledge via the physical arrangement of stuff. Libraries and filing cabinets are the most obvious examples, but a lot of analog tools/instruments embodied a lot of knowledge in their design. A smartphone is the opposite of this: it's an omni-device but all the various functions require using the right software/app. Analog measurement and calculating tools, such as scale balances, slide rules, or sundials, do only one thing, in contrast, but they physically encode knowledge about they quantities they deal with. And they build intuition for those quantities as a natural side-effect of learning to use them.\nDigital organization of data started off following the same format as organization of records in the physical world: files inside of folders. However, over time these digital systems took more advantage of not having the constraints of a physical filing cabinet and have embraced features like tagging and linking. Now it's becoming possible to do fuzzy AI-enabled searches even on your own files; as long as you can remember that something exists, it's getting easier to find it even if it isn't well organized. I appreciated this description of the tradeoff between sorting and searching from Algorithms to Live By (and also appreciated their tip about applying this to sheets of paper by keeping a single stack in \"last touched\" order) in my mini-review of that book:\nFinally, because of the firehouse of information that I spent some time discussing in the previous section, I think a key aspect of knowledge management going forward is going to be curation. Discarding the chaff and highlighting the gems is going to matter as much or more than just acquiring information.\nThat brings us to the end of this first post in my new series. Yeah, there's a lot here, and this post is all over the place. This is a broad topic and I'm trying to get my ideas on paper as part of thinking through them more deliberately. Hopefully as I continue to read some books and write some other posts I have planned on this topic, I'll get some further ideas and be able to refine some of the ones I've shared already.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A round-up of my writing theme for 2024 (that spilled over into 2025), along with some highlights from what I learned or that stood out in some way\nOver the past year and a half, I've been working on a series/theme about industry (and closely-related stuff like supply chains). This post is a wrap-up of this series, although I expect that it's a topic I may return to from time to time in the future.\nThis theme got started in my last post of 2023. Here is an abridged version of how I introduced it:\nThe first entry in the series was an overview post. It included some \"How it's made\" -style videos and the following definition of industry:\nIt also includes discussion of various categories of industries, along with stats on exports from multiple countries—stats that are in the middle of a shake-up here in 2025.\nNext in the series was an exploration of some of the relevant topics from the book Growth by Vaclav Smil. Topics like windmills, transportation, the energy and material fluxes of cities, and the extent to which dematerialization is or isn't achievable. Something Smil writes about the steel industry is relevant to repeat here:\nLater in the series, I looked back on a series of plant closures in northern New Brunswick over the course of about a decade and a half. This region has seen a decline in both power generation and the labour force; I concluded that, \"I fear that once industry has gone away, it's hard to get it spun back up.\" At the end of the post I included some discussion about tacit/implicit knowledge and how it means industry \"exists as a going concern or doesn't exist at all\". (Put a mental marker here because this link between industry and knowledge will come up multiple times in this post).\nThe last main post in this series was a collection of mini-reviews on half a dozen books I read on this theme in 2024. Go to the bottom of that post for some take-aways I had from this reading, but I'll repeat a few of the key ones here:\nAnother idea I got from reflecting on this reading was seeing \"the industrial mode of production as a meta-technology: an ecosystem of physical equipment, relationships, and more, that comes together to make technological artifacts.\" Other \"meta-technologies like technical education and communication\" are integral to \"capture [in Robert Friedel's usage]: the process by which new discoveries get retained and disseminated instead of being ephemeral\". (This is another occurrence of the link between industry and knowledge).\nAside from these main posts in the series, a couple of links posts last year included some content related to industry.\nThere are also a few posts from my archives that can be considered part of the industry series/theme avant la lettre:\nA book review of The Most Powerful Idea in the World; it had a couple of quotes that emphasize legal and cultural contributors to innovation:\nAnother post looked at some writings by Lewis and Tolkien on how to avoid \"bent work\". In it I drew a distinction between artisanal and industrial modes of production (but argued that neither one need be intrinsically \"bent\"). I also described how modern industry depends on a whole ecosystem:\nAlso based on the writings of C.S. Lewis, I had a post expanding on the line from The Abolition of Man saying that, \"what we call Man's power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument\". The way in which technology (including industrial production and supply chains viewed as a meta-technology) can amplify power differences is one of the ethical considerations we should keep in mind when thinking about technology.\nNow that I've looked back at the posts that were part of this reading & writing theme on industry and technology, I want to offer some overall conclusions and concepts that I continue to muse on.\nTherefore, I've decided to make the topic of knowledge and its management my next theme/series on this blog. In my year in review post, I wrote that,\nI also wrote on Facebook about my plans for this reading and writing theme for 2025 (and it will likely stretch into 2026 seeing how the Industry theme spanned more than one year):\nI've already done some reading on this theme, and have also started using some PKM software. So watch for upcoming posts on knowledge, its limits, its curation, etc. I also plan to have other posts that aren't part of this series in the remainder of 2025.\nDoing this series on my blog ended up being even more timely than I thought it would be when I began. It's long been recognized that industry has a strategic dimension; there's an interchangeability (in both directions) between ploughshares and swords. The whole tariff & trade war situation has brought this more front of mind than it usually is (and hopefully this all stays confined to what Connectography calls tug-of-war). On this topic, I'll share what Peter Zeihan has to say. Not because he's guaranteed to be correct, but because he's been talking about re-shoring for a long time so his perspective is more informed than the partisanship-driven takes of commenters who only tuned in to this topic earlier this year.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A collection of mini-reviews, all on my reading theme for 2024; for other books I read last year see my other mini-review post.\nThis post is the culmination of a goal I had last year to read several books on the theme of industrial production and adjacent topics such as technology and supply chains. These are the six books:\nThese relate to the theme from different perspectives.  Material World is a global tour of the processing and products of some of the most fundamental materials in our current economy. The Perfectionists explores the historical development of ever-finer precision in manufacturing. Paper is the history of a single industry. Connectography has to do with supply chains, infrastructure, and the geopolitics associated with them. From the Garden to the City covers some theological and ethical considerations around technology. Finally, A Culture of Improvement is a longitudinal history of technology and innovation in the West.\nMaterial World would be my top recommendation for a general audience. The Perfectionists is very well written (it's not the first book I've read by Simon Winchester, and I'm planning to read another one of his next year) but its appeal may be more niche—definitely recommended for engineers and anyone with a passion for mechanical things. A Culture of Improvement would make a good basis for a history class (e.g. if you're home-schooling a high schooler with an interest in technology) because it surveys a thousand-year span of history, and developments in technology frequently touch on other things that were going on. From the Garden to the City is recommended if you're a Christian and want to be thoughtful and deliberate in the way you and your family use technology. Paper was alright, but I've read another book by Mark Kurlansky (Salt) and it was better. Connectography I found didn't really offer enough ideas to justify reading the full book; finding a magazine article or podcast appearance by the author would probably be a better use of your time if you're interested in its content.\nAs should come as no surprise, considering it covers six books, this is a very long post. Unlike posts where I just cover one or two books, I haven't tried to write full reviews. Instead, for each book I have a section below where I share some excerpts that stood out followed by point-form notes on other key points. At the end of this post, I have a section where I bring together some recurring concepts that I noticed from reading multiple books related to this common theme. I'd suggest readers just skim a section or two from whichever book(s) sounded the most appealing in the previous couple of paragraphs, then jump down to the final section where I try to highlight my most notable take-aways.\nThe dematerialization debate is something I've discussed before (e.g. in this post). Material World is about the parts of our modern industrial economy that are still material-intensive, and about how much we depend on them.\nThe author identifies 6 materials (or categories in a couple of cases) that are vital to our civilization yet often taken for granted. These are listed as subcategories below.\nMaterial World is also a book about global supply chains. This was very relevant in the aftermath of the pandemic and is even more so now in 2025 in the midst of tariff/trade disputes. Ed Conway describes how supply chains create networks of people who don’t know each other but yet can work together to make something useful:\nHe refers to the well-known essay \"I, Pencil\" on this topic.\nAnother thing from the introduction that stood out to me was where he says he looked into why gold was (briefly) one of the UK's biggest exports. I had wondered the same thing while writing this post and apparently the answer is: \"As far as I could make out, part of the answer was that much of the world’s physical gold passes through London on its way somewhere else.\"\nMaterial World is divided into 6 sections, on: sand (incl concrete and silicon), salt(s), steel, copper, petroleum and plastics, and lithium. I'm going to share some interesting facts and notable processes from each of these sections, and then some overall takeaways from the book.\nThe section on sand has a lot of overlap with a book about sand that I read several years ago. However, I'd say Material World covers it better. The thing about sand is that it is such a commonplace material but some of its uses are very strategic. Aside from semiconductors, which I'll focus on in this section, other uses of sand include land reclamation, as a component of concrete, and for glass, including lenses and fibre optics.\nConway brings readers along as he follows the global supply chain for semiconductors:\nI mapped out the route he took in Google Earth (see the following screenshot):\nWhile TSMC might be approaching a household name these days, a lot of the upstream suppliers are not. Of course, tracing the path the silicon takes is not the only part of the supply chain. There are the photolithography machines from ASML in the Netherlands (which themselves use optics from Zeiss in Germany), special quartz crucibles from a couple of special mines in North Carolina, specialty chemicals, and more.\nWhy does this supply chain span the globe? For cutting-edge chips (Intel's 4004 back in 1971 had 2,000 transistors while current chips have over 12 billion!), ten 9's of purity are needed. With that little room for error, it's necessary to use the best supplier at every stage: the best quality silica sand to start with, the best processing techniques, the best photolithography equipment. This processing is also highly energy-intensive:\nThese chips have become a highly strategic item:\nConway draws parallels to the lengths countries went to to acquire rifle scopes and binoculars (also made by Zeiss, he points out) in WW1:\nWhile I've mainly focused on semiconductors in this sub-section, I did want to briefly touch on concrete. I learned that there are 80 tonnes of concrete per person in the world. And its availability can make a big difference. Conway recounts that Mexican families switching from dirt floors to concrete floors experienced a 78% drop in parasitic infections. This relates to what he outright labels as a \"recurring theme\" (emphasis added):\nThe section of Material World on salt had a lot of overlap with the book by Mark Kurlansky of that name. So I'll skip the historical material in this mini-review.\nSomething that stood out to me from this section was how enduring or \"sticky\" the legacy of salt extraction is to the present day in terms of where chemical companies are located. There's a lot of path-dependence in clusters of infrastructure and skills:\nAside from NaCl, this section covers other salts (like nitrates and potassium compounds) used for fertilizers and munitions. Before the invention of the Haber-Bosch process that made synthetic nitrogen fertilizers commonplace, nitrates were so sought-after that a war was fought among Chile, Bolivia, and Peru for access to deposits of them.\nThis section also covers important chemical processes that use salt as an input:\nThese products are in turn inputs to all sorts of other processes that make modern civilization possible. Not the least of which, in my view, being water and wastewater treatment. Note that the Haber-Bosch and Chloralkali processes are very energy-intensive.\nHere are some things that I learned or that stood out to me in the section on iron and steel:\nLetting steel refining go overseas reduces local pollution and gets emissions off the books. However, it introduces some supply chain vulnerability that a lot of leaders are suddenly waking up to.\nHow is iron processed into steel?\nConway calls copper “civilization’s nervous system”. It's main and most important application is conducting electricity. As the world attempts to electrify more sectors (most obviously transportation) the demand for copper is likely to keep increasing.\nApparently the average car contains around a mile of copper wire, and electric cars are well above this amount.\nOne crucial use of copper wire is in windings. If a long wire is coiled up compactly with the right geometry, it can make current (or otherwise convert between electricity and magnetism). I find it fascinating that simply arranging a single element–and copper used for electrical purposes is very pure, to the extent that only electrolytic refining is good enough for the final processing step–into a special shape can be so useful.\nBecause copper is in high demand but its ore deposits are typically low-purity, copper mines are some of the largest in the world. A couple that are discussed in Material World are Bingham Canyon and Chuquicamata.\nAfter it is mined, copper needs to be smelted. This requires a lot of energy. Swansea in Wales gained the nickname \"Copperopolis\" because of how much copper was smelted there, despite not a lot of it being mined in the vicinity. This is because Wales had plentiful coal deposits and it made more sense to bring the copper to the coal than vice versa. Material World points out that China has adopted this model–not just for copper but for many metals–of importing ore and then exporting processed metal. Although China also imports energy, so they've gone a step further than the Swansea approach.\nThe section on oil & gas in Material World covers two applications: energy, and as a feedstock for materials. One of the inescapable facts about materials processing is that it is very energy-intensive:\nHowever, there's a whole petrochemical industry beyond just the use of oil & gas for energy. Germany, for example, has tons of coal while lacking other natural resources. But their chemical engineers figured out how to use it as a feedstock for a diversified chemical industry, even surprising things like dyes and drugs. Later, the ability of their refineries to make liquid fuels from coal kept their planes and tanks going in WW2:\nPlastics are byproducts of oil refining (and there’s an interesting story in how marketing was used to create demand so they didn’t have to be wasted, i.e. flared). They’re cheap because of the demand for gas and diesel. Material World has plenty to say about the widely-used polyethylene. Other plastic families include styrene, polypropylene, nylon, vinyls (like PVC), and epoxies (“thermosetting”):\nSomething that stood out to me is that this section has a whole chapter called simply “Pipes”—it makes the point that refineries are a bewildering maze of pipes and vessels but effect the remarkable transformation of crude into a host of useful products.\nFinally, a couple of facts that are notable in light of current trade disputes (\"tug-of-war\" as Connectography, reviewed below, would have it):\nOf the six categories of materials in Material World, the most recent to rise to prominence is Lithium. This is because it has useful chemistry for batteries. Electric cars are the quintessential users of lithium-based batteries (the battery is the expensive part, like the engine in an ICE car), and have contributed to a steep rise in demand for it:\nThe section on lithium goes from deposits in the Atacama desert in South America to a tour of a Tesla Gigafactory. The factory is split between Tesla and Panasonic. Interestingly, there is a legacy of cassette/VCR companies in producing these types of batteries because they get wound up like jelly rolls. The Gigafactory is far ahead of other companies in its battery output; however, 80% of global production of lithium batteries is in China.\nOne of the challenges with moving to batteries is that their energy density is much lower than liquid fuels; this is partially offset by batteries being multi-use (rechargeable, and later recyclable). On top of this, the countries with reserves aren’t totally comfortable with mining it:\nConway gives a reality check that electrification of transportation and other sectors won't be easy:\nMoving past looking at these materials individually, Material World has some overall conclusions that are worth discussing. A theme that permeates the book is that we’ve forgotten the material foundations of our economy because that sector has gotten so efficient with labour:\nPart of the reason for things getting cheaper is Wright's Law.\nConway is trying to remind readers of the material foundations of our economy and that even things viewed as sustainable such as renewable energy will require large inputs from the material world of mining and metal processing:\nI enjoyed reading this book and I'm a bit jealous of all the sites the author contrived to tour for his research.\nI'll end this mini-review with reference to a site he did not tour or mention. Becancour QC has an industrial park with chloralkali and silicon plants (and also an aluminum smelter). It is located next to a nuclear reactor. This is not a coincidence. Affordable and reliable energy is key to the materials processing that is an indispensable step in strategic supply chains like those discussed in Material World.\nThe Perfectionists is about precision engineering; you could even say it's about the very idea of precision, its historical development, and essential role in so much of what we take for granted in modern technologies and the modern economy. It's by Simon Winchester, who's a talented writer and has lived an interesting life, from working in offshore O&G in the North Sea to being a foreign correspondent. I've read a previous book he wrote (about some of his travels in Asia). He comes by his interest in precision honestly, as his father was a passionate mechanical engineer.\nThe chapters are arranged chronologically, and also in order of increasing precision, from Harrison marine chronometers losing less than a second per day to modern GPS satellites keeping time to tens of nanoseconds (although these examples both have to do with time, precision in dimensions occupies more of the book). Speaking of Harrison's clocks, this really illustrates the way with words the author has:\nWinchester calls precision an invention rather than a discovery:\nTolerances are limits on imprecision and they are key to having parts work together (as anyone who's gotten into 3D printing can tell you):\nA key element of precision, at least for it to have the economic impact that it has over the past 2 to 3 centuries, is that it must be replicable. It's not enough for a Part A to fit with a Part B; rather, any Part A must fit with any Part B. This is where machine tools had a huge advantage over hand-machining—you can still achieve a very good fit with sufficient skill, but parts won’t be interchangeable:\nThis point about what a game-changer it is making things in quantity and at low cost comes up more than once in The Perfectionists, and also in some of the other books covered in this post.\nAn instance of precision that was very impressive at the time, and an important stepping stone even if it has been surpassed by now, was John Wilkinson boring steam engine cylinders to an accuracy of a tenth of an inch using a technique he developed for machining cannons.\nThe Perfectionists has a lot to say about Henry Maudslay. His inventions included very good screws, a method for flatness, and the micrometer. He was also involved in making machines to make pulley blocks for the Portsmouth Block Mills. Ships in that era required something like 1400 blocks each and they took 16 operations to manufacture, so being able to mass-produce them was a big win for British naval power.\nIn this era, education for engineers (in Britain, anyway, other books covered in this post discuss differences in other countries like France and the US) was quite informal:\nThere was a lot of optimism about the potential of new technologies, as exemplified by the Great Exhibition of 1851 and World's Fairs that followed it. The Great Exhibition was hosted in a building called the Crystal Palace, which had almost 1 million square feet of glass panels and was built in 6 months (hard to imagine something of this scale being built so quickly today).\nI liked this poem by Tennyson that was written for the 1862 International Exhibition for its realistic view that new technologies can be used for peace or war:\nMoving into the 20th century, The Perfectionists has an illuminating side-by-side comparison of Rolls Royce and Ford. It's probably not too much of a stretch to consider some of their characteristics as being typical, perhaps, of broader differences in British and American manufacturing. Rolls Royce focused on bespoke hand construction whereas Ford became famous for the assembly line.\nThe Model T saw 16.5 million units produced in ~20 years. Whereas Rolls Royce had only 8000 units in about the same length of time, just two per day, as Winchester emphasizes. He also makes a point about how vital it was to have precise and interchangeable—interchangeable as a result of being precise—parts to make mass production work:\nThe original Model T had less than 100 parts while a modern car has over 30,000 (and a 787 has over 2 million!).\nOne of the most amazing applications of precision in the modern world is the manufacture of jet engines. Reading The Perfectionists gave me an appreciation for how incredible they are. Despite being open at both ends, they reach many multiples of atmospheric pressure inside. Furthermore, they reach temperatures higher than the melting temperatures of the alloy the blades are made of. Oh, and the turbine blades need to be a single crystal (no grain boundaries) in order to have sufficient strength. Winchester rightly calls jet engines, \"beasts of extreme complexity bound up within a design of extraordinary simplicity\":\nThe part where the bulk air is hotter than the melting point of the turbine blades is dealt with by precisely placing holes so there’s an ultra-thin laminar layer of cooling air directly over the blade:\nThe part where blades are grown from a single crystal uses a \"pigtail\" method (which doesn't sound too far off of alchemy to the uninitiated) and proprietary annealing conditions:\nAnother amazing application of precision in the modern world is the manufacture of computer chips. In 2015, over 14 trillion transistors per second were made, and they are unimaginably tiny:\nThe state-of-the-art process for this is EUV photolithography. It is a painstaking process (also discussed in Material World above):\nThe Perfectionists covers plenty of topics that I haven't touched on in this mini-review, but I'll wrap up this section with this quote from Winchester on the current state of precision:\nI have read and enjoyed a book by Mark Kurlansky before (Salt, reviewed here). Paper is a product I use, an industry that I've had as customers in the course of my job, and even something I've tried my own hand at making. So Kurlansky's book Paper was a logical choice for a longitudinal view of a single industry to fit into my reading theme for 2024.\nOne of the first things I noticed is that he has a perspective on technology that is opposite to Marshall McLuhan:\nPaper (as distinct from papyrus, parchment, and amate) was invented in China (during the Han dynasty, c. 105 A.D.) and diffused out to the rest of the world. In Asia, paper found many uses beyond writing, including fans, lanterns, and the walls of houses.\nBefore paper came to the Middle East and Europe, there was papyrus and parchment. The latter was invented in Pergamum and the Romans started using it for codices in the 1st century BC. Parchment was more durable so it didn't disappear once paper became available, but it was very expensive: it took over 200 sheep to make enough parchment for 1 Bible.\nAlthough today when we think of paper, we associate it strongly with wood pulp, this is a relatively recent development. For most of its history, paper was made from bark or from rags; wood is only ~50% cellulose, compared to 90%+ for cotton rags so it is a more intensive process to make paper from wood pulp.\nHere's a summary of the geographic spread of paper mills as recounted in Paper: There was a paper mill in Baghdad in 794 (there was already one in Samarqand prior to this, demonstrating the movement of this technology along the Silk Road). Notable early European mills were in Xativa, Spain and Fabriano, Italy; Fabriano pioneered watermarks and a few other innovations (drop hammers, animal-based sizing (sizing doesn't refer to the dimensions but to surface treatments to make it better for writing on), wire molds). The first paper mill in America was the Rittenhouse mill in Philadelphia area in 1690, almost a millennium after Baghdad.\nPaper mills required water for two reasons: power (driving water wheels) and also for making the pulp. The water needs to be clean (an old guideline was that trout should live in the stream) so that the paper is of good quality and not discoloured.\nEven in early mills, there was a division of labour, between a \"vatman\" (drawing the paper slurry out of a vat) and \"coucher\" (placing the sheets to start drying):\nAs noted, Kurlansky takes the opposite view from McLuhan (i.e. that \"staple\" media strongly shape society and culture) and instead sees needs in culture and the economy as the driver of new technologies. This comes out in excerpts like this:\nSo in his view an expanding need for paper for everything from laws and bureaucratic records, to maps, sheet music, and later, books and newspapers, drove innovation in printing and paper-making rather than the availability of these new/improved technologies facilitating creativity in other endeavours. Personally, I think there's feedback in both directions between technology and society, but probably incline a bit more to the McLuhan side of this debate.\nGetting a working printing press took more than one innovation:\nSpeaking of Gutenberg, I thought Kurlansky gave the Reformation short shrift. It only got five pages in a book about the impact of paper and printing. Here's some of what he had to say about it:\nHaving an affordable, even disposable, medium opened up a lot of new possibilities. This aligns with what the previous books in this post had to say about materials needing to be plentiful and affordable to truly realize their usefulness:\nThe printing press leapt ahead of the paper-making technology of its day, so that the supply of paper (or rags to make it) couldn't keep up:\nBritish newspaper circulation was almost 30 million by 1820. Rag-based paper couldn't keep up (most paper in Europe was made from rags into the 19th C.). So the connection between paper mills and press barons wasn't a coincidence as the supply of paper was a limiting factor for publications.\nThe demand for paper was increasing before wood pulp process was discovered and commercialized, which is one point in favour of Kurlansky's view that demand in society drives technological breakthroughs more than new technologies shape society. He credits the idea for paper from wood pulp to Réaumur and his observations of wasps’ nests.\nThere are now multiple pulping processes such as the sulfite process and the Kraft process. Here is a description of modern paper mills:\nKurlansky also notes that handmade paper hasn't disappeared:\nThere was a quote from Diderot that I thought was nicely related to the theme of this post and the series it's part of:\nThis quote and the following one also provide a good segue from this current theme/series, to the next one I'm planning (on knowing) as one of the things I've learned from this reading is the crucial role of knowledge getting applied to industrial production:\nIt didn't fit in anywhere above, but I'll mention that Paper describes the same typical Chinese industrial strategy as Material World: import raw materials (and energy), produce far above domestic needs, export surplus.\nThis quote from The Olympian Affair, a steampunk novel by Jim Butcher, is about how good logistics is dual-use (i.e. has military applications). This very much fits the current geopolitical context that prompted me to read about supply chains and strategic industries—in early 2025 even moreso than a year ago.\nIn this interlude, I wanted to step back and look at the big picture. The benefits of the industrial mode of production hit home for me when I was browsing in a fabric store with my wife while I was in the middle of reading some of the history of the Industrial Revolution (I think it was The Perfectionists that I was in at the time, although it may have been Paper). I had the realization that in this one store in one small Canadian city, there were enough bolts of fabric to comprise a king's ransom if you went back just 250 years (Cartwright’s power loom, which was originally water powered, was patented in 1785 and mechanized weaving; spinning was already mechanized at this point).\nHowever, I don't want to overlook the darker aspects of industry. One of those is safety (although this has gotten way better over the past 40 or 50 years). This aspect is illustrated in a really gripping and poignant way by a show I watched on Netflix last year called \"The Railwaymen\". It was about the Bhopal disaster. Here are a few notes about it:\nSome ethical issues around industrial production are also raised in this song about Fritz Haber. He contributed to the Haber-Bosch process, which is vital for providing enough fertilizer to feed the world, but he also researched chlorine gas as a chemical weapon (but even chlorine has good and beneficial applications, as we've seen above).\nConnectography by Parag Khanna was a bit frustrating to read because I didn't feel it delved deeply enough for a book-length treatment. Instead, it felt like repetitive examples of a few ideas. Interesting ideas, to be sure, but as I noted in the introduction to this post, you'd probably get as much out of a magazine article or podcast interview featuring the author as you would from reading the book.\nAlso... it was published in 2016 and I read it in 2024. Obviously, a lot happened geopolitically in that interval. So several trends and predictions in Connectography haven't fared so well. However, others are looking pretty insightful. Actually, I find there's some value in reading books in this genre with somewhat of a lag since you can partially calibrate how good the analysis is rather than being credulous about it all.\nThe title of the book refers to the geography of connection, and I'll start with some excerpts that summarize some of the key ideas:\nThe notion of the connective infrastructure layer being more informative than the political layer is one of the things that looked better in 2016 than in 2024/2025 (more on this below), but connective infrastructure is absolutely something to take into account when looking at geography.\nBorders have gotten a lot more fractal.\nGlobal megacities were growing in influence and national governments were weakening in influence.\nI was hoping the book would go into more detail about the working of supply chains, as that was the reason I included it in the reading I did for this post and this theme.\nOne of the clearest statements of the theme of Connectography is that,\nAnother theme that needs to be noted is a central metaphor of \"tug-of-war\" replacing war war:\nThe way I'm going to organize the rest of this mini-review is by looking at parts that have aged well versus parts that haven't, and then sharing some miscellaneous points that stood out or are useful information.\nThe perspective that Connectography is written from is optimistic in an end-of-history way, technocratic in a way I consider typical of the EU (although Parag Khanna is an Indian-American), and bullish on China (and Asia more generally). It has some overlap in tone and general outlook with Dawn of Eurasia by Bruno Maçães (which I reviewed here). It contrasts heavily with the perspective of someone like Peter Zeihan, who is bearish on China (for demographic reasons among other things) and has been predicting a pullback of globalization.\nAnd, well, between the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and current tariff disputes, globalization isn't looking as strong as it was in 2016. So let's consider some of Khanna's points with the benefit of 8 years' worth of hindsight:\nI think the hits and misses listed above all have a common thread. Like Dawn of Eurasia, the analysis in Connectography seems suited for the prevailing international relations (IR) conditions in the 3 decades from 1990 - 2020. There's an excellent description of IR Neorealism in this blog post about a video game that lists a series of conditions: interstate anarchy, hegemony, balance of power, international law (possibly seen as a mask for imperial power). I think there's a real possibility that the world is shifting into a balance of power mode (although I wouldn't call it a foregone conclusion). This quote about security provision versus infrastructure provision, for example, is something that I think is highly dependent on the prevailing IR conditions:\nTo wrap up my mini-review of Connectography, here are a few more points that I thought were interesting or useful for reference:\nSomething I wrote on Facebook with regards to Canada's vulnerability to a trade war due to our dearth of connective infrastructure fits well with the themes of Connectography, so I'll share it here too:\nFrom the Garden to the City by John Dyer is a study of technology in the Bible, followed by some discussions of present-day applications. I included it in this project to cover the moral and ethical angle. The applications in the book focused (though not entirely) on digital technology, but I'm going to try to relate them to industry and supply chains.\nTo begin this mini-review, here are a few excerpts that summarize some of the main points:\nThe last line of the previous excerpt is probably the most repeated point in From the Garden to the City: that we need to be mindful not only of the ends to which we direct technology, but also of the effects that using it has on ourselves. Here are some of the reiterations of this point:\nOr,\nA shovel is a simple example, but the same principle applies to our apps and devices. Where using the former can develop calluses on our hands and muscles in our arms, the latter do something similar to our brains:\nI don't want to spend too much time on what Dyer has to say about digital apps and devices as that isn't the focus of this series I'm writing. However, it's such a ubiquitous part of contemporary life and he says some things that are challenging and worth reflecting on so I don't want to pass over this entirely. Some examples that expand on the previous excerpt are the way the implicit effect of Twitter is \"increasing our ability to consume short, disconnected sentences\" or for social platforms in general they get us \"thinking about events throughout the day in terms of how post-worthy they might be, rather than reflecting on the meaning of our lives\". Or when it comes to streaming, he writes that, \"We don’t want to err into determinism and argue that streaming services made anyone do anything, but neither do we want to err into instrumentalism and say that the change in medium didn’t matter or had no effect. ... When our devices change, our culture changes\" (more on the determinism vs. instrumentalism question below). An example of this might be that due to the personalization that streaming offers we have fewer and fewer references/allusions in common with our neighbours. And a great parenting tip related to this topic is to teach kids to be more than passive consumers:\nBefore getting into the application to industry, I'll take a brief detour through some definitions and debates. Firstly, here are some definitions he gives for technology:\nThe main debate covered is between instrumental and deterministic perspectives on technology:\nIn one of the excerpts above, Dyer quotes a student of Marshall McLuhan's. In fact, in multiple places he makes reference to the ideas of McLuhan or those who built on them (e.g. Neil Postman, who pointed out that technology is like an ecosystem and adding a new form changes the balance). The views of this school would be more towards the determinism side; in my review of Understanding Media by Marshall McLuhan, I explained the well-known phrase, \"The Medium is the Message\" as emphasizing that \"the impact of the content carried by any particular form of media is negligible compared to the impact of the structure of the prevailing media on society\" (and what McLuhan calls media is broader than how most people use the term, encompassing any communications technology and even transportation). I think Dyer is aiming for a via media between these two perspectives, but is using references like these to push back against a strictly instrumental view that technology is neutral and the only moral question is what you use it for. Instead, you should consider the way values are implicitly embedded into the things we make by the problems they solve; that is, even what we see as a problem needing to be solved is a value judgement. For example (and these are his examples, not my own), cars allow for flexible individual travel and phones allow for being constantly connected. They're an embodiment of valuing these things. Dyer's take on the printing press and the values it contains stood out to me as being directly opposed to Kurlanksy's view discussed above (i.e. that society shapes technology rather than technology shaping society):\nI also really liked this scriptural take on \"the medium is the message\" (or one could say, \"the Mediator is the Word\"):\nWe'll now look at what John Dyer says about industry. Something I've become more aware of over the past couple of years as I've been deliberately thinking and reading about industry is basically what he says here about \"sociotechnical systems\"; it's not sufficient to plop down the right equipment in the middle of nowhere but rather modern manufacturing is a whole ecosystem that depends on supply chains, education and training of a skilled workforce, a large variety of supporting businesses, finance, etc.:\nTechnology is dependent on other technology. Cars need roads (and refineries), cellphones need towers (and batteries, and towers, etc), even the most basic agriculture benefits from having pottery for storage and cooking. It’s a stack. Likewise, the following point definitely came up other books discussed in this post (especially Material World and Connectography):\nIn From the Garden to the City, Dyer offers a rubric for evaluating technology and how we use it. If it was just the first row, it would reduce to the \"Instrumentalist\" perspective, where the only moral/ethical consideration is what it is used for. However, as I've mentioned he emphasizes throughout the book that we also need to think about unintentional effects, such as how using a particular technology shapes ourselves or the culture around us, and this is where the second row comes in. Both rows have a positive and negative potential.\nPositive\nNegative\nIntentional\n3. Redemption\n2. Rebellion\nUnintentional\n1. Reflection\n4. Restoration\nHere is part of the explanation that goes with this rubric:\nWhen I thought through applying this rubric/tetrad to the industrial mode of production, it occurred to me that it's sort of a meta-technology. That is, a technology (including both physical equipment and \"sociotechnical\" aspects) for making other technologies. (Supply chains are also kind of a meta-technology that allows for not being vertically integrated or co-located.) So it's at a higher level of abstraction.\nSo with this in mind, applying the above rubric to industry, for the first row I'd ask a question like whether the product is more beneficial than harmful? For example, cheese and paper vs cigarettes and chemical weapons. However, even things that are generally beneficial can be put to bad ends (e.g. gluttony), and some things that are often harmful can still have some positive uses. I think I mentioned chlorine earlier in this post, which was invented as a chemical weapon but has found widespread use in drinking water disinfection. Cases like that probably come with a duty of care to do due diligence on one's customers, though.\nMoving to the second row, industry has a lot of unintentional effects—a mixture of positive and negative:\nWhere Dyer says he's settled for himself and his family as an approach to technology (mostly with respect to apps and devices) is that it should be \"for the table\", meaning that communication with people who aren't present should be secondary to and in service of the times that you can be face-to-face, sharing a meal with family and friends and similar quality relational time. Such a priority can probably also inform our approach to industry, I imagine.\nHave you ever thought about organs (the instrument, not the body parts)? Now they seem very staid but there was a time when they were cutting-edge. In fact, the skills to make them were a mere hop, skip, and a jump from highly strategic applications: a metal tube with precise dimensions that you blast pressurized gas through has much wider utility than just making music.\nThis is just one technology discussed in A Culture of Improvement by Robert Friedel. It is subtitled Technology and the Western Millennium, and it does a really thorough job covering technological developments in the Western world over a span of 1,000 years. Not only that, but as the organ example shows, it does a good job showing how different developments are connected.\nNow it would be far beyond the scope of this review to attempt to cover a book with a 1,000-year timeline comprehensively, so instead I'll try to pull out some interesting tidbits and also explore some points of overlap with other books I read for this project.\nFirst, however, I'll lay out the core of Friedel's thesis. He offers it as an explanation for why technology in the Western world leapt so dramatically ahead of the rest of the world. This leap became extremely obvious in the nineteenth century, but he starts his account centuries before that because he emphasizes how one thing built upon another; there were incremental improvements that snowballed bigger and bigger. The key thing, in Friedel's view, is that the snowball had a chance to grow. What he thinks made the difference in Europe (and later in North America), is not the amount of invention and innovation going on, but what he calls capture. This is the process by which new discoveries get retained and disseminated instead of being ephemeral. To this end, a lot of A Culture of Improvement has to do with what I think of as meta-technologies: methods of technical education and communication, ways of organizing production (whether forms of private ownership or government bodies and policies), etc.\nHere are some excerpts from Chapter 1 that explain \"capture\" and how it keeps inventions and innovations from being ephemeral:\n(These last two excerpts are closely related to the theme I'm exploring after this one about industry. This next theme is about knowledge, its boundaries, and its management. Specifically, a draft post I've started based on some articles by Samo Burja has a lot of overlap with this concept of capture.)\nThe remainder of this section of this post will be point-form notes on interesting things from A Culture of Improvement:\nFriedel's concluding chapter has the following moral caution that's a good spot to end this mini-review:\nThe books I've shared some notes from in this post have covered technologies and materials as diverse as steel, silicon, jet engines, microchips, cars, phones, paper, and pipe organs. And the processes and supply chains that go into making them (in quantity and at a price to be accessible to a mass market). This topic felt relevant as I was reading these books last year, and it feels even more relevant as I've compiled this post and published it in the middle of a trade war (and also the angst in the UK over the prospect of losing primary steel production).\nHere are some take-aways I have after doing this reading and writing:\nPermalink",

    "content": "These are books that I read last year (plus one or two non-books) that didn't fit into my theme on Industry/Technology/Supply Chains—for which a similar collection of reviews is still pending. I've done similar posts in prior years.\nEunoia by Christian Bök, is a literary experiment of sorts. Each chapter is named after a vowel, and only has vocabulary that contains that vowel and no others. The chapters are only united by this common constraint; there isn't a unifying plot (and even within chapters it drifts around a bit). Eunoia was enjoyable to read for the linguistic mastery on display, in the same way some poetry is. The main drawback was that it was needlessly crude in places.\nMy favourite part was the retelling of the Iliad (which at the time of writing this post I'm currently reading) in the E chapter. Here's an excerpt:\nThis selection from the I chapter also displays Bök's wordsmithing skills:\nI've read and enjoyed some works by G.K. Chesterton in the past, and last year I read a couple of more: Orthodoxy and Heretics. I also listened to an audiobook version of the Ballad of the White Horse. Because Chesterton's works are out of copyright, you can pick up free ebooks of any of these and many of his other books.\nOrthodoxy was written in 1908, but comes across as timeless. In comparison, Heretics, which was written 3 or 4 years earlier, deals with specific figures and ideas that were current in Chesterton's day. So Orthodoxy is the one I'd most recommend. It is about Chesterton's intellectual journey. On it, he found that Christian orthodoxy matched his moral intuitions about stuff like suicide, equality and hierarchy, optimism and pessimism, fallenness. And that it makes sense of the world—not only of straightforward stuff, but that it has mysteries and paradoxes matching complexities in the world.\nCompared to my more developed review posts, in mini-reviews, I mainly share some quotes and points that stood out to me. So that's what the remainder of this section will be.\nVirtues should stand together, not in isolation (this is relevant for current debates about empathy, for example):\nThese excerpts were one of the key points of the book in my opinion:\nRegarding solipsism and the self-destroying nature of skepticism, he goes on to write \"It has no more questions to ask; it has questioned itself. You cannot call up any wilder vision than a city in which men ask themselves if they have any selves. You cannot fancy a more sceptical world than that in which men doubt if there is a world.\"\nThe quote about democracy at the end of this post comes from Orthodoxy.\nHis intuition against suicide, and its contrast with martyrs:\nAnother key point that he makes is one that I mentioned in the first paragraph of this section: that complexities in the world are matched by paradoxes in Christian orthodoxy.\nI really liked this passage about complexity:\nMazes are fractal-like but not regular. Not compressible in an information sense. This is a topic I've been thinking about in the context of my series on industry (see the discussion of fractals in the past two links posts, for example). \"A stick might fit a hole or a stone a hollow by accident. But a key and a lock are both complex. And if a key fits a lock, you know it is the right key.\"\nIn one spot he makes the point that, from an orthodox perspective, nature is not our mother but our sister.\nI also thought this part was profound, contrasting maintenance with conservatism. Preservation takes active work. This is a major theme of The Ballad of the White Horse, as well.\n(Emphasis added)\nThis next quote I thought was remarkable for having been written not only before the Second World War, but before the First World War.\nLastly, here's a good reminder of the historical context in which orthodoxy is rooted:\nAs I mentioned in the previous subsection, Heretics deals with specific figures and ideas that were current in Chesterton's day. For example, Ibsen, Shaw, H.G. Wells, Lowes Dickinson, McCabe, George Moore. Some are still well known, but many are now far less remembered than Chesterton himself. It can be read as a view into the debates happening at the end of the Victorian era, even if half the people he argues against are no longer relevant, but this is definitely not the book I'd steer people towards who are just getting into Chesterton's works. In this subsection I'll include a few things that stood out to me, but won't try to organize it much or add more than minimal commentary.\nTalk of progress is meaningless if you don't clearly define a goal you're progressing towards:\nGreat line!\nOn Kipling, whom I have a fondness for, Chesterton says his main theme was discipline (not only military):\nBut he complains that Kipling was too cosmopolitan.\nThe chapter on H.G. Wells was the best one in the book, in my view. Chesterton effectively criticizes \"scientific marriage\" and other utopian ideas:\nThis part made a profound philosophical point:\nAs I mentioned in my notes on Orthodoxy, Chesteron was writing against Nietzsche and eugenics before the First World War:\nA couple of points about paganism fit in pretty well with the last quote from Orthodoxy I shared above:\nThis point fits in well with a few of the initial quotes I shared above from Orthodoxy:\nHere's a good quote to wrap up this subsection.\nThe Ballad of the White Horse is amazing. I listened to the audiobook version of it three times last year. It made me want to raise the flag of Wessex and pledge allegiance to King Alfred.\nI decided to check out The Ballad of the White Horse after reading this book review (which I also robustly recommend reading) and already being in a bit of a Chesterton mood. Rather than reading it, I decided to listen to the audiobook (freely available here) because it is an epic poem, and those are best enjoyed by hearing them recited.\nIt is loosely based on King Alfred defending his kingdom from the heathen Danes, but acknowledges right in the foreword or introduction that it is striving to tell an epic legend over being historically accurate.\nIt opens with the situation looking pretty bleak. This stanza comes from the first book and has a really arresting line (emphasis added):\nHe has a vision and rather than receiving any guarantee of victory, it simply shows him the need for fighting:\nSo he musters some allies and goes to the battle.\nThe title refers to this white horse and the final book makes the theme explicit. Each generation must rise to the challenge that is before them (this theme and some of the ways it was expressed made me wonder in places if Tolkien drew some inspiration from this poem).\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a section of the longer Hindu epic Mahabharata. It is an extended discourse between Prince Arjuna and his chariot driver on the eve of a battle. The chariot driver is Krishna (an avatar of Vishnu) and part of the conversation involves him revealing himself. But they talk about other stuff, too, including the tension between duty and seeking a life of meditation/piety/withdrawal. Early in the book, Krishna expounds on the eternal existence and transmigration of the soul—in the context of telling a warrior that it's okay to kill (which is not the context I was expecting for this teaching).\nArjuna is encouraged in chapters 2 and 3 to a unity of meditation and action. He's also exhorted to what struck me as an almost-Stoic \"equability\". Along with shunning desire, he should also distance himself from the external sense-world—but still act in it somehow:\nBut,\nThe synthesis here, as near as I can figure it out, is to \"stand aloof\" from your own acts; what's called for is to combine meditation and action, in unselfconscious deeds without desire; perhaps it isn't too much of a stretch to say that you shouldn't have a rooting interest in yourself?\nAfter a discussion and vision of Krishna's true identity, the conversation turns back to earth with guidance on how to practically serve him. I liked this part:\nAnd similarly this part:\nIt’s notable how much practical morality and good character overlap, even between religions with vastly different worldviews. What C.S. Lewis called the Tao.\nI also really found these lines thought-provoking:\nThe ending (in chapter 18) is back to commending renunciation but still encouraging doing one’s duty, with the synthesis of works without attachment or desire.\nLes Fourmis (\"The Ants\") by Bernard Werber is a French novel that is hard to categorize, but fits as sci-fi as well as anywhere. Uniquely (as far as I know), it alternates between human and ant perspectives.\nOn the human side, Jonathan Wells inherits an apartment from his uncle Edmond. This uncle is a mysterious character. He was a biologist, initially a microbiologist and later an entomologist. He was a troubled child and semi-estranged from his family as an adult. Oh, and his cause of death was from a massive wasp attack. Adding to the mystery, this apartment he left to a nephew he had rarely seen came with strict instructions to never go in the cellar. As the novel continues, we learn that he had spent some time doing research in Africa before returning to France, and that he was working on an encyclopedia about his work (that many of his former academic colleagues covet greatly) before he died.\nOn the ant side, there is the daily struggle to find enough food and protect the ant hill from other animals as well as rival species of ants. Initially this is mainly through the eyes of a male ant, number 327, but we meet other ants and follow their POV as the novel progresses. There are mysteries in and around the ant hill as well. A foraging party gets wiped out with no sign that they even raised a pheromone alarm or took up defensive postures. Number 327 gets attacked by other ants inside the colony, which shouldn't happen.\nLes Fourmis kept me guessing about how these two storylines would manage to come together, but in the last 30 pages or so everything is indeed revealed. Even little things like TV shows that Jonathan's son Nicolas was watching at various points turned out to be relevant. It ends in a way that leaves it set up for a sequel (it's actually the first novel in a trilogy), which I haven't decided if I want to try to read. I enjoyed Les Fourmis, but reading a full-length novel in a foreign language is a lot of work. I found it easier to understand the human scenes than the ant scenes because the vocabulary is more common/everyday.\nHere are some excerpts that give the flavour of this novel.\nThere is a brainteaser that is repeated in several places (eventually the answer is given) on how to make 4 triangles with only 6 matchsticks:\nThe ants have their own way of organizing their societies, and they have their own philosophies:\nThe ants also have recitations to remind themselves about their roles and duties. Here is one about being an explorer:\nThere are periodic entries from Uncle Edmond's encyclopedia (du savoir relatif et absolu) scattered throughout the novel. Here is part of one as an example:\n(apologies for missing the accents in these excerpts).\nOne of the strengths of Les Fourmis is the diversity of ant behaviours it describes/displays. So I can't think of a better way to wrap up this mini-review than to share a video of a war (there is more than one war in the novel!) in an ant farm:\nIn this movie from India, a young man is travelling back to his family home with his new wife after their wedding. It's a long train ride and everyone falls asleep. When he wakes at his station, he quickly rouses who he thinks is his bride and disembarks. However, there were multiple newlywed couples on the train and the girls were all wearing similar wedding apparel, complete with veils that obscured their faces. From the combination of the darkness, the veils, and not knowing his wife very well yet (it was an arranged marriage), he takes the wrong girl home with him. This mix-up leads to some humourous as well as poignant moments. Several literal laugh-out-loud instances for sure. The exact circumstances are very cultural-specific, but the formula felt almost Shakespearean. In places it could seem a bit preachy, but on topics that aren't controversial many places outside rural India (e.g. the bride's family shouldn't be compelled to pay a large dowry) so there was nothing that pulled me out of enjoying it as an entertaining story.\nThis is a collection of short stories by Liu Cixin. He is best know for The Three Body Problem. In this collection, I'd say I liked \"Sun of China\" the best. It has two main threads: a migrant from the impoverished countryside trying to make it in a big city, and a project to improve the climate (especially but not exclusively in arid regions of Western China, such as the protagonist's hometown) using a giant reflector in geosynchronous orbit. Although he's known as a sci-fi author, I find the strongest parts of Liu Cixin's writing are about recent history; the way he draws on the experiences of the Chinese people within living memory is the most compelling aspect of his work. For example, the early portion of The Three Body Problem set during the Cultural Revolution was one of the most memorable parts of that book for me. The arc in \"Sun of China\" of the son of peasant farmers migrating to Beijing (or another coastal megacity) and trying to find work and housing is something millions of people have lived through in my own lifetime. Having that side of the story added a lot of interest compared to if he had just made it about a geoengineering project.\nThe final story in the anthology, titled \"Cannonball\", is about an exotic new material, a megaproject built with it, and intergenerational accountability for crimes.\nI also enjoyed the short story \"With Her Eyes\". And the titular \"The Wandering Earth\", \"Mountain\", and \"Curse 5.0\" were alright. A lot of the others had an interesting idea or two but weren't really that memorable.\nErewhon (\"Nowhere\" backwards, with the wh treated as a digraph) is a utopian satire akin to Gulliver's Travels. It was written in 1872 by Samuel Butler, although the version I have is a later edition published in 1901 and available from Project Gutenberg. It starts and ends with a framing story and in between is more of an exploration of ideas. The narrator, who is never named, is initially farming sheep in some British colony and wonders what lies beyond the next mountain range. Per Wikipedia, Butler spent time on a sheep station in New Zealand, so this part draws on personal experience. He gets a native guide, crosses a couple of passes (ditching his guide along the way because he's entering a taboo area), and ends up in an unknown country. The frame story of the book very enjoyable to read. The descriptions of travel in the mountains are well-written and detailed enough that you can tell Butler has done it himself (indeed, my understanding is that he did a fair bit of hiking, both in New Zealand and the Italian Alps).\nThe two things he notices most prominently in this strange land is that everyone is healthy and attractive, and the technology level is several centuries behind England. By the time he has learned the language and made his way to the capital of Erewhon, the book really reaches its utopian satire core. There have been hints of these points in earlier chapters, but they can generally be summarized as the treatment of physical ailments and moral lapses being reversed from the England of Butler's day. Sickness and other bodily afflictions are a criminal offense in Erewhon, while things that would be crimes in England (like embezzlement) are treated as an infirmity. A class of professionals known as straighteners prescribe treatments for these things; the treatments may sound punitive (e.g. monthly floggings for a year) but are accepted willingly and may even make for good stories rather than being a source of shame (much like someone in England might feel about a surgery, even if it was painful). Some implications of this reversal are fleshed out, like Erewhonians covering up colds and other minor illnesses as best as possible (with friends politely turning a blind eye if you make excuses for why you can't go out); and like straighteners dabbling in various vices as part of their education, so that they can understand them better.\nUnfortunately, a society where those who aggress against or victimize others are given prescriptions instead of penalties isn't so fantastical as it was in Butler's day.\nI can't fully pin down what this criminal approach to sickness/misfortune is supposed to satirize. One possibility is that it is primarily intended to reflect the criminal justice system in England. By transferring some of its features to a different domain, perhaps Butler was expecting people to think more about things they had previously taken for granted. And there's a philosophical question lurking: if you don't believe in free will, isn't any distinction between conditions that should be treated and those that should be punished rather arbitrary? Another possibility is that he's satirizing social darwinism, and just making the punishment of the sick and down-on-their-luck active rather than passive. There could even be some proto-eugenics going on (the argument for this is that all of the Erewhonians aside from prisoners and defendants are healthy and good looking).\nIn a section talking about art in Erewhon, I found this excerpt amusing:\nAfter some sections about Erewhonian religion and attitudes to children, and the narrator's courtship of his hosts' daughter, there's a part about education, that surprised me with how closely it parallels some contemporary debates about the cost of post-secondary education:\nRather than spend years of their lives obtaining credentials of questionable practicality, he thinks they could be sent to apprentice at a trade.\nTheir education system is big on conformity and agreeableness:\nWhile the narrator is in the university town of Erewhon, a professor of antiquity gives him a run-down of the \"machinist/anti-machinist war\" and a copy of the book—\"The Book of the Machines\"—that inspired this conflict. It is not called this in Erewhon, but the \"Butlerian Jihad\" in Dune was named by Frank Herbert in honour of Samuel Butler as an allusion to this conflict. As in Dune, the actual war against the machines takes place off-screen, so to speak.\nA few chapters near the end of Erewhon comprise the narrator's translation of \"The Book of the Machines\". It was the arguments presented in this book that convinced the Erewhonians to purge their country of any advanced machinery. The core thesis is that machines are evolving very rapidly and on a long enough timeline they will surpass biological life.\nHere is a representative excerpt or two:\nThe final couple of chapters return to more of a narrative as opposed to an exploration of ideas. The narrator and his lover escape from Erewhon on a hot air balloon that he proposed to demonstrate to the Queen and King (not having much in the way of moving parts it didn't count as forbidden machinery). They are rescued by a passing ship, married by a clergyman aboard, and make their way to London. Back in London, the narrator comes up with a plan for what to do with his knowledge of Erewhon. He wants to achieve the conversion of the people there (still believing them to be the 10 Lost Tribes), and also wants to make a profit. His plan is to raise capital by selling shares, then do a bit of gunboat evangelism. This expedition would pay for itself by recruiting Erewhonians as indentured labour for Queensland. I assume their is some continued satirical social commentary going on here.\nSome parts of Erewhon have aged better than others. I think the main reason it is still known and discussed is \"The Book of the Machines\" (chapters 22-25). Note that this part (i.e. the namesake of the Butlerian Jihad) is not an incidental digression; even looking at it structurally it's in the place of the climax of the story, with everything coming after serving as denouement. Erewhon's also decent as an adventure story in the vein of The Lost World, Gulliver's Travels, or Lost Horizon. The writing is quite good; whether he's describing travel through the mountains or some philosophical ideas, Butler has turns of phrase that are frequently evocative. Also, it's a fast read.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A photo essay. Originally I wanted to go to these sites and take my own photos, but that didn't work out timing-wise last year, so the photos are a curated collection from Google Earth and news articles. I didn't want to put off writing this waiting for photos, because this is a very timely topic. Not only is it a continuation of my series on industry and supply chains and related topics, but it is also directly relevant to re-shoring attempts and trade/tariff disputes.\nThe Bay of Chaleur coastline in northern New Brunswick used to have a significant amount of heavy industry relative to its population. It had/has some notable advantages, such as better rail access than most of the Maritimes and a deep water port at Belledune. However, in the previous decade or two a lot of this went away. Trying to understand the past can contribute to planning for the future of industry, in this region and elsewhere in Canada.\nBathurst is a small city that was formerly home to a large pulp and paper mill. It went through various owners during its years of operation, but at the time it ceased production in 2005 it was owned by Smurfit-Stone. During the past twenty years, the site went through additional owners but did not get cleaned up or redeveloped. Finally, last year the provincial government took ownership after there were no takers at a tax auction. Some of the remaining long-delayed demolition work is now underway.\nHere's a photo of what the mill looked like when it was still standing, followed by one showing the condition the site has been in in recent years:\nNext, here is a photo of some demolition in progress.\nI also grabbed some screenshots from Google Earth from when the site was still standing (no longer in operation, but no demolition had occurred) followed by its condition in recent years (until site clean-up resumed in late 2024). Of special interest to me are the two UASB reactors for treating wastewater from the plant, near the centre of the image along the river.\nThis paper mill closure was not the only one in the province to face closure. The Dalhousie one will be covered in a later section of this post; both it and Bathurst are in this alphabet of closed P&P mills in Canada. Additionally, there was the Repap/UPM mill in Miramichi (formerly known as Newcastle, and around 70 km south of Bathurst) that closed in 2007. At the head of the Bay of Chaleur, the mill in Atholville had closed in the 1990s, but reopened under the ownership of the Aditya Birla Group (in 1997), which also happened with the mill in Nackawic (in the western part of the province) around a decade later in 2006.\nAlso in the Bathurst area (just over 20 km to the southwest) was Brunswick Mines. This zinc and lead mine was in production from 1964 - 2013. The metal from this mine was smelted in Belledune, as described in the next section.\nBelledune is a tiny village, but it has a deep water port and a thermal power plant, which gives it good industrial potential. The big industry there was a smelter. It continued operating (on ore brought in from elsewhere) after Brunswick Mines ceased production, but shut down in 2019. This followed a months-long labour dispute and the cancellation of an upgrade project. In the present context with the rising importance of batteries and threatened tariffs from the United States it is worth noting that a lot of the lead smelted here was exported to the US for battery manufacturers, and after it closed there were only two lead smelters in North America left, one in British Columbia and one in the Mexican border state of Coahuila.\nThe coal-fired power plant in Belledune is still operating, but it is slated to shut down in 2030. See this graph 3/4 of the way down the page from a post I made several years ago showing the impact of its closure on power generation capacity in the province: the red segments of the bars show what will be lost when it closes in 2030 instead of its earlier plan of running until 2040.\nDemolition and site rehabilitation of the smelter is currently in progress. Here is a picture of the Belledune waterfront, with the smelter in the foreground and the power plant in the background:\nHere is a picture of some of the demolition work:\nAnd here's a good satellite image of the smelter site from Google Earth from back when it was in operation (note the full parking lot):\nBelledune has not given up on industry. There was an attempt to bring in an iron-ore processing plant (Maritime Iron Inc.) around the same time the smelter closed down. However, this fell through after NB Power pulled out of a partnership because of concerns the project would be affected by the federal phase-out of coal in 2030 (iron smelting consumes coal, at least with conventional methods) and that greenhouse gas emissions from it would be attributed to NB Power and require raising rates for all their customers (to pass on the costs of the carbon tax). David Campbell points out that this project could have re-shored some iron processing to North America from Asia and laments what could have been:\nAgain in the present context of a trade showdown with the United States, having a stronger domestic supply chain for iron and steel would be an advantage right about now.\nBelledune does still have its port. They do a brisk trade in biomass (wood pellets) and are hoping to get into green hydrogen. That is a similar idea to what Stephenville NL is planning. Frankly, I'm skeptical of trying to plop such a challenging industry into places that don't have a robust chemical processing cluster already. Hydrogen is challenging to store and transport, so having off-takers in close proximity is a big advantage. Having a large operator labour pool and constellation of contractors with relevant skills is also useful. I wish them well, but I think these small communities would have a better shot pursuing industries that play to their strengths (e.g. processing resources that are sourced nearby, or dealing with something that is shipped in bulk in the case of Belledune with its port having experience with that).\nDalhousie is a town near the inner end of the bay that also had a large pulp and paper mill: International Paper, later Abitibi-Bowater. It closed in 2008. According to Wikipedia, it had produced 640 tonnes per day of newsprint.\nHere is a historical photo of when this mill was in full operation:\nThere was also a 315 MW generating station in Dalhousie. It burned Orimulsion, which was sourced from Venezuela. (Important parenthetical: despite Canada being a net exporter of oil and gas, power plants and refineries on the east coast import it from abroad due to limitations in infrastructure for moving this resource within the country). The political situation there led to them ceasing to sell this fuel to Canada in 2006 (and no new supply contracts after 2004). Decommissioning of the plant started in 2013. Some elements—just the tank farm as far as I can tell—are still a work in progress, but the dramatic moment came in 2015 when the power plant and its smoke stacks were demolished. The first attempt at demolishing the power plant did not bring down the stacks, as caught on video here:\nThey did come down on a second attempt later that year (2015). Here is a picture of that power plant before it was demolished:\nHere are some screenshots from Google Earth of the generating station and the paper mill sites in 2009 and 2024, respectively. The sites have mostly been levelled (aside from a tank farm at the generating station), but they have not been redeveloped. The town would like to pivot from industry to \"investing in tourism, arts and culture\".\nThere was also a chloralkali plant on the west end of Dalhousie (shown in the Google Earth screenshot below) which also ceased production in 2008.\nSo in summary, this region had closures of half a dozen industries or power plants between 2005 and 2019. It also had a billion dollar project (i.e. Maritime Iron Inc.) fall through. And another power plant is scheduled to shut down in 2030. These closures are a tough blow for a relatively small region (in 2016 the combined population of Gloucester and Restigouche counties, which encompass the Bay of Chaleur coastline plus some adjacent areas, was only around 109,000 people). And as I said in the introduction, this is a region that has some features that should help it to attract and retain industry. So what went wrong? I don't know the deep background of each of these closures, but there are some potential factors that jumped out at me from the research I did for this post:\nI fear that once industry has gone away, it's hard to get it spun back up. I commented in a discussion elsewhere about vital infrastructure that,\nSomeone else had a thought-provoking reply:\nThere's a balancing act to be struck, however, in keeping industry a going concern in a certain geography while not propping up sluggish firms or obsolete sectors; allowing failure is a crucial part of properly allocating resources, as this article points out:\nI hope that at least some of these industrial sites in the Chaleur region that have been swept bare can eventually hold productive new industries.\nPermalink",

    "content": "300 posts is a major milestone and a good time to look back on past writing and reflect on why I write a blog.\nThe Ghost blogging platform that I use informs me that this is my 300th post since I started this blog around 11 years ago. My own count is off by 1 or 2 (I think there may have been a post I deleted and re-uploaded to fix a URL or something like that) but we'll go with this as the \"official\" milestone.\nWhen I reflected on all this writing over a decade plus, these were some points that stood out to me in terms of the value I see in it along with thoughts about the writing process:\nand\nFor anyone that started reading my blog more recently, I thought I'd take this opportunity to share some recommended posts (scroll down further for the full archive). In previous milestone posts, I already listed some notable ones from the earlier years of The Drafting Table, so the ones listed here are from the past 100 posts. These are listed in (roughly) the order they were published as opposed to being a ranking:\nThis is a pretty good representation of the range of topics I like to write about.\nFor the convenience of anyone who wants to browse in The Drafting Table archive, here are links to all 300 (or 299 as the case may be) posts. Some of the older posts that kept a running archive (Year in Review ones, for example—bolded in the list below to visually break it up; by the way, each Year In Review post is also a good source for mentioning my favourite posts from that year) had links broken during a blogging platform software update, so it's good to have a working list all in one

    "content": "After several years without one, I got a new 3D printer in 2024. This post explores what I've been doing with it.\nAt the start of last year, I got an Ender 3 V3 KE. However, it didn't work initially. I had an issue basically the same as described here: during the first-time calibration it kept failing at the point where the nozzle pushes down on the plate. Customer support sent me a replacement strain gauge and that didn't work. After months of troubleshooting (not a tonne of time in total, just spread out to odd evenings and weekends when I had the chance to work on it), what finally got it working was re-seating all the cables between the strain gauge and the main control board. One of them must have had a poor connection and the expected signal was absent—which certainly matches the observed symptoms—because it has worked fine ever since.\nAfter that, I've been able to print a bunch of stuff: a mixture of my own designs and ones I've downloaded, and ranging from toys to useful items.\nWhen it comes to my own designs, I have a general workflow that I made a short video to demonstrate. The part in this video, a plastic bushing for a manual coffee grinder, took less than 10 minutes to print (the design process took a bit longer, but even it went pretty fast) and successfully fixed the grinder.\nLast year for Christmas I built a dollhouse (actually instead of dolls it mainly gets used with Calico Critters bunnies). The 3d printer has provided a source of furniture and accessories (not the exclusive source though) for this dollhouse. Some of this is my own design, namely a canoe, bookshelf, and floor lamp. I've also printed some other designs I've found, such as a wardrobe (in addition to storing their clothes, the bunnies can go to Narnia, after we read it) and a mini 3D printer (scaled down and deleting some layers of nesting from this model). Some of these things have been my elder daughter's request, including the 3D printer which impressed me by her creativity. I guess it's not too early to start teaching about recursion or maybe even von Neumann machines, haha.\nI also made 2 sundials. One was from following this tutorial. The other was my own design. Aside from working through the tutorial, I did some reading on Wikipedia to understand the theory well enough to come up with a working design. Here are some excerpts describing different types of sundials:\nThe key common features in the geometry of a sundial are:\nOther things I've used my 3d printer for are:\n(The impact of the printing press has come up in a lot of what I've read recently, from Marshall McLuhan, to some books about the history of industry—a post on that is sitting in my drafts—to one I'm reading right now about the history of knowledge by Simon Winchester).\nI have several ideas for things I want to try 3d printing in 2025. For one, I expect I'll continue to make some toys, whether that's more dollhouse furniture or other stuff like a spirograph. In the useful category, perhaps a cupholder for our stroller. I've seen some designs for models of jet engines that look pretty cool; and I'd like to try making a design for an astrolabe (I like measuring, calculating, and navigating instruments in general) at some point. I might also re-visit this design (from this post) to see if I can improve it.\nIf you enjoyed this post, here's a couple from the archives I also recommend:\nPermalink",

    "content": "These books are for the 1.5-3.5 age range (in my experience so far, noting that each child is unique and will mature at different rates with respect to their understanding of stories and specific interests). They are ones that my eldest daughter has enjoyed (and hopefully her sibling(s) will as they reach the suitable ages. They are also ones that aren't too tedious to read out loud over and over as an adult. This may well be a topic I revisit for older age ranges.\nIn no particular order, here are some from our shelves (and one from the library) that I'm happy to recommend:\nMortimer's First Garden, by Karma Wilson\nA cute story about a mouse planting a seed, that also conveys the message that there's something of the miraculous in all growth.\nBabar and his children, by Jean de Brunhoff\nBabar and his wife have kids, and then everyone is kept busy rescuing them from danger. The vocabulary is not dumbed down, and in places the sentence construction bears traces of the French it was translated from. We also have a Babar book by de Brunhoff's son that sees the elephant royal family travel around the world and learn a little bit about different languages and cultures.\nThe Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss\nI find Dr. Seuss fun to read aloud because of his playful mastery of language. Some people find his made-up nonsense words annoying, but there are definitely books of his such as this one that keep them to a minimum (Oh, the Places You'll Go is another one we have that's pretty good on that score). Somehow we ended up with a version that includes a Spanish translation on each page. The translation is pretty literal and doesn't preserve the poetry—but still occasionally lands phrases that roll off the tongue nicely like \"dijo el pez en la tetera\". It is also fun to ponder as an adult whether it's written with an unreliable narrator and e.g. Thing 1 and Thing 2 are simply the unrestrained id of each child.\nBedtime for Frances, by Russell Hoban\nThis book has a lot of repetitiveness, but it's integral to the relatability of the story, so it doesn't feel tedious. We also have a couple of other books by the same author.\nAngelina Ballerina, by Katharine Holabird\nAngelina is a mouse. Through ballet lessons, she becomes more disciplined. Other books in the series also teach pro-social values.\nThe Fourteen Bears: Summer and Winter, by Evelyn Scott\nUnlike the books above, this one doesn't really have a plot. Instead it's simply about two normal days (one in summer and one in winter) in the lives of a family of bears. The illustrations are what make this. Each bear has his or her unique space with different decor. They are drawn as individuals, so even though there are fourteen of them, they can still be identified if you try. It's possible to spot new visual details almost every time you read it.\nWhat Do People Do All Day?, by Richard Scarry\nThis book is a great introduction to the idea of jobs and money. The selection of jobs is very mid-century (and some of the technologies shown would have been obsolete even then, such as steam-powered construction equipment) but has good coverage of the breadth of the economy, from primary sectors, to manufacturing, to services. The drawings make me think of The Way Things Work by David Macaulay (a book I loved as a child, have gotten for a nephew, and plan to get for my own kids when they're the right age), adapted for the younger set. The page shown here is about water treatment, a topic I'm very familiar with, and I appreciate that while it is simplified, it's not wrong.\nA couple of concluding thoughts are that used bookstores are a great place to look for books for young children. Whatever you get, it's always going to be new to them, and books that are still in circulation have probably endured for a reason. I've also noticed that before children start reading for themselves, the quality of the illustrations is one of the biggest factors for keeping their attention. I've listed the books above with their authors, but truth be told the illustrators (who are the same in some cases but not all) should probably get as much or perhaps more credit.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This year's writing on The Drafting Table and general life updates.\nIn 2024, I wrote 9 posts including this one. That's down slightly from last year, but on par with 2020; my annual average from 2020 - 2024 has been 9.6. Having two kids under the age of four goes a long way towards explaining why I'm not writing as much as I used to (back in 2019, I had even started working on a book, which I still intend to pick back up in another season of life). To be clear, I'm just explaining here, not bemoaning/complaining. I really appreciate this essay by Paul Graham (which I may have shared before, but don't mind recommending more than once) where he writes about how having children changed him, and mentions that small children are \"fascinatingly complex characters\". They certainly are.\nHere's the list of my posts from this year:\nAt the end of last year, I selected a theme of industry and adjacent topics (supply chains, technology, etc.) to focus some of my reading and writing on in 2024. I ended up reading six books about it, and so far have written two posts (plus my links posts included some content related to this theme). I still have 1-3 more posts planned (such as notes from the reading I did and a round-up of what has stood out to me from doing this series). In 2025, if I can get this series wrapped up before too long into the new year, I next want to take up a theme of knowledge and its curation.\nIn total, I read 20 books this past year. Half were novels so the books related to the industry theme comprised the majority of the non-fiction. I hope to write mini-reviews for some of these books in the new year.\nIn 2024 I got a new 3d printer and have enjoyed getting back in to 3d printing. I've made some dollhouse furniture, some stocking stuffers, and a sundial, among other things. I plan to write a post sharing my designs in the new year. Other DIY projects from this year were:\nOver on LinkedIn, I made a few predictions for 2025 that I'll also share here:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Six years ago, I wrote a post about updating a netbook I was running Linux on, and what I installed on it. This year, my Windows desktop died, so I replaced it and thought a similar post about what I set up on it would be interesting: both as a potential source of ideas for software readers may find useful, and as a record of what I was using now that I can look back on down the road to see how it's changed.\nOne thing that anyone who has set up a Windows PC recently has probably experienced is that you are nudged pretty forcefully into using OneDrive. This meme reflects my feelings on this.\nWhen my old PC died, I was able to recover files by putting the old hard drive in an external hard drive enclosure, plugging it into my Linux laptop (this part was necessary because the new PC didn't recognize me as the same user with access to those files, but I could at least see them as 'read only' in Linux) and transferring everything using SCP. With OneDrive, something like this wouldn't be necessary as long as it works. But if it doesn't work or you lose your credentials, I don't know what recourse you have.\nI also got a new work cellphone this year. Here's a list of some of the apps (not counting the work-related ones like Teams and Concur) that I added to it:\nSmart phones are a single device that have combined many functions, from photography to navigation. (I do find it a bit ironic that this same logic hasn't been applied to simplify away from apps that don't do anything that can't be done in a browser). As noted in my previous post, cellphones are, along with cars, among the defining artifacts of our society. They facilitate managing our own movement and communication. Or to put it in terminology used by Marshall McLuhan, these could be considered our \"staple media\". As such, it behooves us to reflect on how we use them instead of doing so uncritically.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Vaclav Smil's book Growth is wide-ranging enough that this isn't a comprehensive review. Rather, I decided to mainly explore just a few topics from it.\nGrowth was one of my five 500+ page books from last year (Lord of the Rings and Journey to the West have already made it into some posts, and I still have some pending writing ideas related to City of God and Champlain's Dream). It also fits right into the theme of industry, technology, and adjacent topics that I've tried to focus some reading and writing in 2024 around. This is the second book by Vaclav Smil that I've read; one chapter had quite a bit of overlap with Harvesting the Biosphere so I won't spend much time on that part of the content in this post.\nGrowth is about how things {organisms, cities, technologies} get bigger {larger in size, more powerful, more numerous} over time. It features numerous graphs, the majority of which show S-shaped curves. A recurring theme is that a lot of phenomena which appear exponential at some stage in their lifecycle eventually turn out to be logistic.\nThis book ranges widely, with the main unifying theme being the dynamics of growth. It provides a good high-level overview of the history of certain technological artifacts—especially those related to energy transformations (engines, motors, turbines, etc.) as they are a prime interest of Smil's. It also has case studies of the population history of selected cities and countries. And lots of discussion of growth and post-growth stagnation or decline applied to various domains. For this post, I'll look at what Growth says about certain technological artifacts (with a short section on windmills broken out to tie in to some previous books I've discussed on this blog), what it says about cities, and what it says about industry. I'll end with a section of miscellaneous notes, because part of the value of reading a book by Vaclav Smil is the wealth of information it provides that can be very useful in back-of-the-envelope estimates on various questions.\nWindmills are one of the many power sources that Smil considers in Growth. He traces their, well, growth, from medieval times to the present day. Over this timespan, they've increased in the amount of power they can provide by a factor of ~1000x, with much of that coming in the past half-century:\nSimilar stories are told in Growth for many other power sources, from water power to jet engines. I chose to highlight windmills because it gave a chance to refer back to (including re-reading key chapters) a couple of other books I've reviewed on this blog: Water on Sand and Designed for Dry Feet.\nIn Designed for Dry Feet by Dr. Robert Hoeksema, it was the third chapter that was most directly about windmills so that's the part I re-read. The north of Amsterdam in the 16th and 17th century was the main setting for this chapter. When I was in the Netherlands, I enjoyed biking through part of that area and seeing some of the preserved windmills at Zaanse Schans. Windmills were used for powering proto-industry such as grinding grain and also for land reclamation via the draining of lakes; experience with the former helped with the latter. To accomplish this land reclamation, dikes and ring canals were built around lakes to be drained and windmills were used to pump water from the interior out to the ring canal. Windmills are thus only one piece of an overall system which is useless without all the other parts. This lake draining \"was possible due to the prosperity of the seventeenth century and was necessary due to the growing demand for food\"—it required raising a lot of capital. Dr. Hoeksema discusses improvements that were made to windmills over this era. There were two major types: post mills (in which the whole structure can rotate to face into the wind) and tower mills (in which only the top cap rotates). To catch variable amounts of wind, windmills could stretch or retract sailcloth over a lattice frame. Another important technical feature for tower mills was having the central power shaft coupled with cogs instead of being a continuous solid member. According to this chapter, an average windmill in this period could lift 0.9 cubic metres of water per second by 1 metre; they had a typical sail span of 25-27 metres and typical wind speeds were 6-11 m/s. This is sufficient information to calculate the power and efficiency. The output works out to 8.8 kW ( = 0.9 m3/s x 1000 kg/m3 x 9.81 m/s2 x 1 m) which is in the range that Smil states for Dutch windmills in the 17th century. The total wind energy (taking the midpoint for sail span and wind speed) is 195 kW ( = 1/2 x 1.2 kg/m3 x 530 m2 x (8.5 m/s)3), giving an efficiency of 4.5%. In a case study on the draining of the Beemster polder, we learn that the contract included a performance test to make sure enough windmills were installed to do the job. This shows how legal/institutional innovations need to go hand-in-glove with technological developments. Also of note is that later on, 2 diesel pumps replaced 50 windmills at the job of keeping Beemster polder dry.\nWater on Sand has multiple authors but it was the second chapter, \"History and Animal Energy in the Arid Zone\" by Richard Bulliet that I wanted to revisit for this post. He contrasts Europe, where population growth led to expensive feed (because animal feed was competing with human food) and draft animals becoming a luxury with the MENA region, where there was lots of non-arable grazing land and thus plentiful/cheap animal power (because it didn't compete with human food). His thesis in this chapter is that animal power is cheapest where it doesn't compete with human food and such places have less incentive for developing non-muscle power. In contrast, places like late medieval or early modern Europe where draft animals are expensive to keep recognize a need for other sources of power, leading to investment and innovation in wind- and water-mills. The MENA region had mill technology earlier or at the same time as Europe—some of it as a legacy from the Roman Empire—but it took off in Europe in the 12th century and not there. There's a debate across various books I've read this year (stay tuned for the next entry in my Industry series that I hope to get posted before the end of the year) about whether technological development drives social change or social conditions instead create an opening for technological development? Bulliet is clearly taking a position on one side of this debate. The contingent (as Bulliet sees it) development of a tech-savvy and entrepreneurial miller class in Europe would be influential in later technological developments like the Industrial Revolution. I actually see this as an example of technology and society influencing each other in turn, though: environmental/economic features gave an impetus to wind and water power; the prevailing power technology led to the rise of a miller class; the presence of millers contributed to industrialization. Of course, this is only one proposed explanation for what's known as the Great Divergence. Other factors I've seen suggested include: cultural/religious factors promoting or stifling science and innovation; specific institutions and their impacts (e.g. Cistercian monasteries exchanging best practices in agriculture, Waqfs tying up capital); arms races between small and nearby kingdoms (i.e. numerous peer competitors) making technological advantages very salient; easily accessible coal deposits.\nWindmills were just one small topic in Growth, and like most of the items that book discusses, they're dealt with in a very zoomed-out fashion, showing improvements over centuries. But I hope this section shows that such an overview can be a good starting point to explore further, whether on technical details or social impacts and interactions.\nIn this section, I'll briefly cover some of what Growth has to say about a few technologies related to power, transportation, and audio-visual communication/media. The book is replete with statistics and graphs on many more technological artifacts (not used in the archaeological sense) than I can cover here (e.g. air travel, the internet), but at least this section of this review can provide a sample. I've chosen a handful of graphs from the book that I found interesting and also representative.\nAlthough individual technologies see their growth rate taper off, a relay of different technologies has resulted in a more-or-less steady increase in the capacity of the biggest engine or turbine at any time. Of course, if more power is needed, using more units rather than simply bigger units is also an option.\nThe next sets of graphs show adoption rates of various appliances and communication/entertainment devices. The rates differ, with things like radio and cellphones spreading much more quickly than stoves or dishwashers, but most of these show the same general trend of an S-curve towards saturation.\nNear the end of Growth, Smil also considers decline. This is seen in the following graphs of successions of different technologies for steelmaking (from Bessemer to Basic Open Hearth to Basic Oxygen Furnace to Electric Arc Furnace) or music-playing.\nI'm interested in the ocean and shipping, so I enjoyed the parts of Growth that dealt with ships as artifacts. Smil presents long term trends in both size and speed. From a description in The Odyssey, he estimates Odysseus' ship would have weighed up to 12 tonnes (and total displacement would be around 40-50% above that). In the Classical era, Greek triremes would have displaced up to 50 tonnes, and the Romans' typical cargo ships had displacements up to 200 tonnes with capacities of around 70 tonnes (although apparently they built some giant ships with capacities of 1,000 tonnes for special purposes). Viking ships were similar in size to Odysseus' from the Bronze Age, while those of Columbus and Magellan from the age of exploration were around 120 - 150 tonnes in terms of displacement. By the 19th century, however, a ship of the line might weigh over 3,000 tonnes (with a displacement correspondingly higher). Smil puts that in context as requiring 6,000 oak trees to build. When it comes to sailing speeds, these increased from around 7 km/h in the Renaissance (scarcely improved from Classical antiquity) to 15 km/h for the fastest clippers to 60 km/h for aircraft carriers. However,\nMy understanding is that trying to push vessel speed runs into Froude number constraints.\nWhen it comes to electrification of transportation, he makes this observation:\nI'd consider the most defining artifacts of the present to be cars and cellphones, and Smil has plenty to say about both of those. Apparently, enough mobile phones are now made for every person on earth to get a new one every 4 years! And 1.5 billion phones are thrown out annually (they have a short life span so disposal trends don't lag production trends by much). Smil makes an attention-getting comparison between the energy footprint of manufacturing cars versus phones. He notes that a car has around 10,000x the mass of a smartphone. The embodied energy (of all the materials and processing) is estimated at 100 GJ for the former and 0.25 GJ for the latter, though: only a 400x difference. Furthermore, way more phones are sold (almost 2 billion per year, versus 72 million vehicles) and they are replaced more often. So Smil estimates that the energy footprint of manufacturing portable electronic devices (he adds in laptops and tablets to make the comparison work) approaches the order of magnitude of manufacturing vehicles (although using them is another matter).\nThe book is 500+ pages of this kind of thing, so this section of the review should give you a good idea of whether it would be one you'd like to read.\nGrowth spends a chapter on the growth of biological organisms (an interesting thing there was scaling rules for various metrics proportional to [body mass]0.75). It also applies this notion of metabolism—explicitly as such—to cities:\nThis excerpt gives a function-focused perspective on cities, considering their inputs and outputs. As a process engineer, this kind of perspective appeals to me. The outputs, especially recently, are not only material goods but also services and intangibles like culture and governance.\nAs it does with artifacts, Growth takes a long historical view towards cities:\nSmil estimates that hunter-gatherer societies had population densities up to 0.002 ppl/ha (1 person per 5 sq. km) or as low as 0.0001 ppl/ha. This rises to 1 ppl/ha for early agriculture (e.g. Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia) and 5 ppl/ha in the most intensive farming locales (mainly in Asia) prior to the mechanization of agriculture and the Green Revolution. Modern agriculture can support 10 ppl/ha (1000 people per sq. km).\nThe Roman empire has some of the best data from the ancient world on the metabolism of a city and the infrastructure needed to support it. Growth contains statistics that during the 2nd century A.D. the empire needed 12 megatonnes of grain per year (for a population of 60 million people), much of which was grown in Egypt, and that the city of Rome had 1 billion litres of water per day supplied via aqueducts. Aside from the aqueducts, the infrastructure that the Roman empire is well known for was their roads:\nSmil also provides estimates for the energy use in the Roman empire, which increased only slowly over the subsequent millennium:\nWhether millennia ago or today, concentrating people in cities has a cost and requires on-going sustenance to maintain:\nI would also note that cities throughout history have often needed to be supplied with people as well, as they have tended to be population sinks (whether due to disease or reduced fertility). I shared some excerpts from Growth on the related issue of aging populations in an earlier post this year. Even in developing countries cities apparently also have higher per capita use of water and energy compared to small towns or rural areas.\nHowever, cities have some compelling advantages to go with their high metabolic needs. Regarding the benefits of spatial concentration Smil refers to Marshall's law, von Thünen's law, and Tobler's law:\nFor reasons such as these, some modern cities have grown to unprecedented sizes, with the energy footprints and other metabolic needs to go with them:\nDensities like these far outpace energy—and remember that food is a form of energy—and material that can be sourced locally:\nSo when cities go much above 200 W/m2 (200 MW per sq. km) for their total energy needs or above 1000 people per sq. km for a population density, they will need to bring in energy and food from beyond their boundaries. This obviously requires infrastructure. Smil points out that pipelines (a 1 m diameter pipeline can transport 50 megatonnes of oil annually) and high-voltage transmission lines are reliable ways to enable energy to be used far from its source. The challenge is that infrastructure requires maintenance and maintenance is easy to defer or neglect:\nI thought it would be worthwhile to engage more deeply on this topic of urban metabolism so I decided to do some ballpark-level analyses on the city of Winnipeg. I've never been there (yet) but it seemed a fitting choice as it is where Professor Smil lives and teaches. Also, cities on the prairies have geometry that simplifies this kind of exercise.\nAccording to per Wikipedia, Winnipeg has a population of 750,000 and an area of 462 sq. km for a population density of 1430/km2 (for the metro area, these rise to 5285 sq. km and 158/km2 but I'll consider the city itself in this analysis); it is surrounded by a beltway (not the exact city boundary, but a decent proxy for it) with an approximate 90 km perimeter. I'll use these values along with the 10 ppl/ha that modern agriculture can support and a few other statistics listed below for some Smil-style calculations about Winnipeg and its \"metabolism\":\nUsing these values, here are some interesting results and comparisons I came up with:\nWinnipeg isn't a seaport, but to illustrate the advantages that coastal cities have when it comes to logistics/metabolism, a single Neopanamax ship can carry 13,000 TEUs (and a TEU has roughly the same capacity as a transport trailer).\nFor any of these \"metabolic\" flows coming from outside the city limits, they can be thought of as a flux across the 90 km perimeter. In fact, entry points are even more discrete than that. As the following pictures illustrate, there's 30 or so roads or rail lines coming in and out of Winnipeg. Of the roads, the TransCanada (Hwy 1) and the route to the US (Hwy 75) are the most significant for goods coming from outside Manitoba. Aside from that, there's also an international airport. The Red River flows through Winnipeg and connects to the United States (including Fargo ND) and to Lake Winnipeg and onward to Hudson Bay but as far as I know it doesn't have any significant barge traffic. 30 surface connections plus an international airport is actually really good for a city of this size, though.\nThe preceding sections certainly have some relevance to my reading and writing theme for 2024 (although I read Growth in 2023) on industry, technology, and supply chains. In this section, though, I'll deal with the more direct things Smil has to say about how things are made and about some macro trends (specifically around dematerialization) related to industrial production.\nDematerialization is a term for the trend of modern economies using less material \"stuff\" relative to their size. This is due to growing trade in non-material items (e.g. the service economy and the digital economy) as well as increasing efficiency. I've referred to it at least a couple of times before on this blog. At the same time, it's good to be reminded that we are material beings in a material world (Material World is the title of one of the stand-out books that I read this year and I'm currently working on a draft post that includes it, so stay tuned!) and will always be reliant on the continuation of some mass and energy flows in the real, physical world. Vaclav Smil makes this point clear:\nOn a similar note, he says,\nAnd a statement underlying this section and also the previous one on urban metabolism is that:\nI think these are critical points, but I also think there is something to dematerialization. As a synthesis, I'd add information to materials and energy.\nLater in Growth, he does have a more balanced statement on dematerialization:\nTaking a couple of industries as specific examples, steel and cement production haven't reached an asymptote. By 2030, Smil projects that they will be around 2.5 Gt/yr and 10 Gt/yr, respectively, and still increasing. He writes,\nI also appreciated this point that it isn't just materials that have enduring significance, but also processes:\nThe next post I have planned in my series on Industry will consider the themes in this section (among other topics) further.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This summer has been very busy with work and family life, so I haven't had much time for writing. The title of this post, set when I started putting it together, reflects this. This blog is not defunct, however, so I wanted to at least share a link round-up like I do semiannually (more-or-less). By the time you're reading this, I will have finished reading the books I'd picked out for this year on the theme of industry/technology; hopefully I'll have some time to do some writing on this theme throughout the fall.\nI came across a great anecdote from the 20th century physicist Richard Feynman that I wanted to share. In my observation and experience (related to research in water & wastewater, primarily), some of the most productive research comes from very ad hoc and janky-looking pilot or bench-scale equipment. Chaotic tangles of tubing, copious usage of zip ties to reinforce connections, that sort of thing. In most facets of water & wastewater, we understandably shy away from the Silicon Valley aphorism to \"move fast and break things\"; full-scale treatment plants (and let's not forget related infrastructure like distribution systems) have a responsibility to provide clean water day after day. However, when it comes to R&D, you can learn more if there's flexibility to rapidly try a lot of different things, with a comfort level around some of them failing. Equipment and systems quickly lose their shine when you repeatedly reconfigure them, but having the freedom to iterate in this way outweighs a lot of bells and whistles. As Feynman explains, something \"completely inelegant\" that you can fiddle with can often outperform \"an insulated box with knobs\".\nThe reading and thinking I've been doing about industry/technology has made me aware that oil refineries and microchips are some of the most complex technological artifacts in existence. I've mentioned before (e.g. in the previous links post I did) the density of linear features and semi-fractal nature; but I figured a picture is worth a thousand words. Observe how there's some visual similarities despite the vast difference (a million times!) in scale:\n(Image sources: Refinery, Microchip)\nOn the subject of images of industrial stuff, I've been enjoying photos from a Facebook group called Industrial Fine Art. Although it's a bit poignant how many of them—especially entries from Great Britain and other parts of Europe—are taken at plants that are shutting down or about to be demolished.\nI enjoyed watching whitewater events like Canoe Slalom and Kayak Cross at the Paris Olympics this year. The current satellite view on Google Maps (preserved below for after it gets updated) of the Olympic whitewater course shows it before it was full of water. I thought it was interesting to see how it was constructed.\nContinuing on the map theme, I've tried making a unified map of Narnia before, so it was neat seeing someone else's attempt.\nWe watch some Chinese movies and TV shows from time to time, so I found this series about how to identify which era/dynasty something is set in quite interesting:\nDid you know that there is a sort of periodic table of knots? Knots were also used for record-keeping by the Incans.\nSticking to mathematical topology, here's a video about practical applications of origami. And an article about how computation goes beyond computers.\nAnd here are two really cool videos on math-y topics:\nEarlier this year, I got a 3d printer again. It took quite a while to get it working due to issues similar to the ones described here, but now that it is up and running, I've been enjoying designing and printing various things. I plan to share about some of these in the next 6 months but for this post, I'll share some really impressive 3d printing (and related) projects/applications I've come across online—these are much more complex than anything I've been doing:\nVR Museums are an idea that I feel has some potential. I can certainly think of a whole bunch of artifacts that I'd like to curate if doing so becomes more accessible. Unfortunately, IRL museums are facing political trends that constrain curation.\nYoung people are facing unprecedented levels of anxiety. They're also facing increasingly-adversarial gender relations. My own kids are quite a bit younger than the age groups that are most affected by these trends, but I'm already asking myself how I can help them steer around them.\nHere's an update on an issue I've shared links about before: regulation and taxation of online content in Canada. Personally, I find it objectionable to make the things I want to watch more expensive in order to fund things the government thinks I should watch. \"There has been an ongoing erasure of shared implicit understandings\" and the way streaming services give everyone the ability to customize their own media consumption (compared to the days when there were three channels) is surely part of it. However, I feel that CanCon rules are a relic from those 3-channel days; there's no going back. Having more of a common culture again would be nice, but the CRTC isn't the right tool for the job.\nMost of the remaining links in this edition are just going to be presented in rapid-fire point form. Some of them are bookmarks for myself to check out in more detail when time permits:\nAre your goals in life such that \"the best possible person to achieve them is a corpse\"? These kinds of goals of negation like not wanting to be a burden or to make mistakes aren't as good as striving to accomplish something real even if you don't achieve it 100%.\nI'll finish this post off with a motivating song:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is to provide some notes from books I read (and a couple of movies that I watched) that aren't going to feature in dedicated posts. See here and here for similar posts from prior years.\nIn 2023, I had set a goal to read five books of 500+ pages: Lord of the Rings, Growth by Vaclav Smil, The Monkey and the Monk (an abridged version of Journey to the West), City of God (also abridged), and Champlain's Dream. Lord of the Rings needs no introduction; it featured in this post from last year. For the Vaclav Smil book, I have an outline/draft in progress that is inspired by it. For Augustine's City of God, I'll probably share some excerpts and notes that stood out at some point—as with other renowned classics, an actual review likely wouldn't have anything fresh to say. Finally, Champlain's Dream is one that I intend to attempt a review, possibly to submit to another site.\nThese five books were not the only things I read last year, so the following post provides some notes, quotes, and mini-reviews of some of the others (along with a couple of movies, and The Monkey and the Monk, which didn't really fit anywhere else). Happy reading!\nThe communications tools we use and the media we consume or participate in are big parts of our lives, yet often remain unexamined (or at least under-examined). Not by Marshall McLuhan, though! His book Understanding Media was written in 1964, but I found it was still very relevant. There were some things that he predicted very insightfully, like the information economy and like so much media being ad-supported; but even where his predictions didn't pan out, this book is still worth reading for the exercise of thinking through the role of media in our lives today.\nIn some ways I found his writing style frustrating to read. Rather than a linear flow, he jumps around from example to example to application, and his theories aren't laid out and justified in any one place. I somewhat suspect the non-lineality is deliberate, as he comments in a few places that one of the side-effects of the written word is a very linear and logical way of thinking rather than seeing the big picture. McLuhan is clearly on the humanities side of the divide discussed by C.P. Snow and as someone on the opposite side (scientific-technical/\"shape rotator\") it's definitely a break from what I'm used to reading his perspective on various technologies. Like, I'm used to studying the mechanics of electricity whereas he's writing about its semiotics. He defines media very broadly, encompassing numerous technologies used for communication and even transportation (it gives the option to deliver a message in person, I guess).\nThis review could easily get much longer than mini, so I'm going to present some point-form notes on aspects of his theory as I understood it, followed by a series of excerpts that I found thought-provoking and/or a good encapsulation of some of the book's main themes.\nHere are some excerpts that stood out to me, along with light commentary:\nThese two excerpts are the intersection of his ideas of media extending our senses and the globalizing nature of electric technology/media.\nMcLuhan thinks that literacy and books have shaped Western conceptions of rationality itself.\nI thought this concept of staple media was useful.\nI would counter here that large aggregations have other drivers: preferential attachment, ease of networking, integrated labour markets. And indeed, cities have grown a lot since he wrote (although now 6 decades later, there's at least a contingent of digital nomads / work from anywhere jobs).\nThe role reversal of cities and the countryside.\nDoes our technology work for us or do we work for it?\nI thought this was a notable take on the map & territory dichotomy, as well as good foresight into the ambitions of Big Data.\nI wouldn't go this far: we need atoms as well as bits. But this was directionally correct about the rise of the information economy (McLuhan also includes advertisements as a form of paid learning, although the payment there is in-kind).\nVery relevant to smartphones, eh?\nAnd this applies in spades to social media and related walled gardens.\nYou need some kind of communication technology to govern at a distance, so the alphabet was a prerequisite for moving beyond city-states, in McLuhan's view.\nOn legibility.\nHere McLuhan draws a straight line from 26 letters to interchangeable parts.\nLiteracy, running water, lineal organization = all connected, in his view.\nMy favourite chapter was number 10: Roads and Paper Routes. He explains how sending messages on papyrus along a network of good roads was crucial to the administration of the Roman empire, governing far-flung provinces. In fact, he connects the decline of bureaucracy and army organization to the lack of papyrus once Rome no longer controlled Egypt.\nHe feels the printing press was very far-reaching in how it affected Western culture.\nRegarding clocks, you can't manage what you can't measure.\nLabour-saving appliances allowed individuals to do their own laundry, etc. rather than having servants or taking it to a laundromat. Rather than saving work, they made it accessible to non-specialists. He thinks this generalizes to electric technology more broadly. I think it's a good insight about appliances, but since Understanding Media was written, there's more specialization in the economy, as far as I can tell.\nIn his telling the sequence goes: printing to homogenization to nationalism; changing media could thus lead to post-nationalism.\nThis is one of several references to Erewhon by Samuel Butler which I plan to read soon.\nThis application of his theory to organizational structure has a lot in common with Conway's Law.\nThe preceding quote is a summary of a major theme.\nHas the electric age changed our conception of freedom?\nHowever, in actuality, electricity has led to more specialization as far as I can tell.\nPerhaps this has swung back with the advent of social media, which has made almost everyone a content producer in at least a small degree?\nAs I said above, I'd encourage people to read this book, not just/mainly for its contents, but for the exercise of thinking through the role of media in our lives. Yes, this is kind of a meta way to end this mini-review.\n(Also, here's a good short talk on the social impact of the printing press and the internet)\nI watched Oppenheimer in theatres when it came out last year. It definitely held my attention. The score was quite interesting and different from typical movie soundtracks. Something that stood out from this movie (and also from First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic from a few years ago) was the culture around technical endeavours back then. It's amazing what they were able to accomplish with chalkboards and slide rules. Wearing suits even when it's highly impractical—like watching explosion tests out in the desert. Much fewer safety precautions. The speed at which they could get things done: building a whole town for like 4,000 people at Los Alamos took less time than many apartment buildings do today. And the personalities involved seemed a lot lower on agreeableness than I'd expect in this kind of R&D now. Dr. Lawrence was one of my favourite characters. Did you know he has not one but two National Laboratories named after him? (It is left as an exercise to the reader why these laboratories have consistently been home to one of the world's top supercomputers).\nThis is an Italian film on Netflix that is based on a true story. It's about an engineer in the late 1960s that builds an offshore platform in the Adriatic, just outside Italy's territorial waters and tries to get it recognized as an independent country. It manages to be quite funny (at least if you share my sense of humour) while also covering a lot of salient topics about micronations. The main character is portrayed as an eccentric idealist. He wants to invent and tinker without being hampered by red tape and permits for everything. An early scene establishes this quite well when he is stopped by police for driving a home-built car that doesn't have a license plate. His idealism faces a couple of challenges: other people come to this man-made island to party in a disco/beach club with few rules and no taxes, meanwhile the Italian government gets nervous about its existence in the febrile political climate of the time. Overall, it's entertaining, and also an interesting case study of an early instance of seasteading.\nAlgorithms to Live By explains various algorithms in computing and offers ways they could be applied to other areas of life (primarily personal organization and productivity). I learned some useful things in reading it, both about algorithms and productivity tips.\nTo keep this review brief, I've arranged it as notes on each chapter, covering two or three algorithms or applications that stood out from each:\nOne of the five long books (~500+ pages) that I had a goal to read last year was an abridged version of The Journey To The West (the version translated and editted by Anthony Yu and titled The Monkey and the Monk). It is very loosely based on a true story: there was a monk during the Tang dynasty that travelled to India to obtain copies of Buddhist scriptures that weren't available in China. However, it departs from realism from the very first chapter. The character who gets the most attention is not the monk but the Monkey King. He is a major brat: very clever at getting out of tricky situations or gaining an advantage and a very skilled fighter, but he has absolutely no humility or self-restraint. He and four other mythical companions become disciples of the monk and accompany/protect him on his journey to the West as penance for various things they've done to offend the Jade Emperor. There's a bewildering array of other Immortals of various ranks that they interact with. I'd liken the structure of this novel to a Buddhist (though it alternately belittles Taoism then is syncretistic with it) version of Pilgrim's Progress—with one chapter (11) that's very Dante-esque. There's probably a lot of allegorical moral lessons, but a lot of them went over my head. There's also a lot of wuxia action; fights between characters with superhuman strength/skills and legendary weapons are a regular occurrence, as in the quote below. There are some humourous moments, too. The best joke was when someone referred to a latrine as a \"Bureau of Five-Grain Transmigration\".\nAfter a poem describing the sand/river monster's weapon (a treasure staff), Bajie/Idiot/Wuneng (characters have multiple names) fights Sha Monk/Sha Wujing/Flowing-Sand:\nFor a story with the ostensible lesson that violence isn't the answer, it sure has a lot of fight scenes described in loving detail...\nI read On The Incarnation by St. Athanasius as part of an online book club of sorts last year. Reading it along with others added to the experience, but I have to say that I found it very readable for something with more than 16 centuries under its belt (although maybe the expectation should be that something so enduring is accessible, hmm). It is also not terribly long. So the benefit:effort ratio was pretty high and I can strongly recommend it. Here, I've included the highlights from my notes from reading through this enduring classic:\nChapters 1 - 3:\nChapters 4 and 5:\nChapters 6 - 8:\nThis year, my reading goal has been focused on a theme of industry, technology, and supply chains. At the time of writing this post, I'm through 4.5 out of 6 books that I'd selected around this theme. Hopefully over the summer I'll find time to write about what I've learned from this.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This marks the tenth year that I've written up an overview of the provincial budget. I've decided that this is probably a good point to wrap this series up (at least for the time being), so this post will look back at the trajectory of the debt and some things I've learned from going through the exercise ten times. (By the way, I published another post just a few days before the provincial budget was released; here is the link if you missed it and are interested).\nThe previous nine posts in this series can be found in the following links. Each one looks at the budget for the fiscal year starting just after it was published (I believe April 1st is the start of the fiscal year for the provincial government). The numbers in each post reflect what was planned; however, since plans for the following year reflect what actually happened in the previous year, the long-term trends should be fairly close (i.e. the numbers I've recorded for the provincial debt are the end-of-year projections, which might have been a bit off in any given year, but the multi-year trend should be pretty close to what actually happened since these projections get updated each year). Many of these posts also analyze a specific topic or department, indicated by the URL.\nAs per usual, I'll try to keep most of the amounts in the discussion below in millions (M) of dollars (CAD) because I think it's easier to compare than mixing million and billions. And while I'll mostly refer to it as the 2024 budget, it is technically for the 2024-2025 fiscal year.\nHere are the sources I used for this post:\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nThe net debt by the end of the fiscal year will represent around 27% of provincial GDP. Note that it is increasing in spite of the surplus in this budget due to the capital budget (a separate document that I haven't been reviewing).\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nIn the following excerpt from the budget document, I've highlighted the biggest expenses and also indicated the percentage increase (or decrease, in the case of the debt service) from what was budgeted last year.\nOn the revenue side of the 2024 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nHere is a pie chart of the various sources of revenue:\nFor this tenth and final post in this series, I went back through the previous posts and charted the revenue, expenses, and provincial debt from each year's budget. As noted in the introduction, what actually happened in any year may have differed a bit from what was in the budget, but the long-term trends are pretty close:\nCoincidentally, the debt is basically back to where it started, in nominal terms anyway. However, from most other ways of looking at it, we're much better off:\n(GDP was $32 billion when I started writing this series (according to my first post), and the population at the time was around 753,000. Now the GDP is $42 billion or more (the latest data currently available is from 2022 and it was reported in chained 2017 dollars so I adjusted it for inflation). The population has increased to around 843,000. This is a 31% increase in (nominal) GDP and a 12% increase in population.)\nThe first few years I did this series of posts, the provincial debt increased by an average of around $620M per year. If this trajectory had continued, we'd now be over $18,000M in debt, or 42% higher. That means the annual debt service would be at least $863M, an extra $255M per year that wouldn't be available for spending on other priorities. In fact, it would probably be higher than this, as the higher debt load would lead to a lower credit rating and thus higher interest rates.\nLooking back on ten years of writing this provincial budget review post, there are a couple of things I learned that I wanted to share:\nI also wanted to share a few things that are on my radar regarding our economic and fiscal situation:\nIndeed this is an issue that many locales are facing, as the following videos make clear:\nA book I read last year, Growth by Vaclav Smil, also touched on this topic (among many others—I hope to write more about it later this year):\nImplications of aging societies include concerns around,\nWhile I'm not intending to continue this annual provincial budget review feature, if you've found this series worth reading, I hope you'll check back occasionally for the other things I write about!\nPermalink",

    "content": "Previously.\nLet's start with a few links related to current events. Scroll down for stuff that's less timely but of more enduring interest if you're reading this page sometime not in the winter of 2024.\nAn issue I continue to follow is Canadian laws affecting online communications (C-11, C-18, and C-21; C-63 now needs to be added to this growing list). With Bill C-18, the government tried to pressure sites like Facebook to compensate media outlets for linking to them (in contrast to the normal expectation that companies pay to have their links promoted on Facebook); instead, Facebook simply declined to allow links to news in Canada anymore. This was a spectacular own-goal by the Canadian media outlets that lobbied for this bill, further diminishing their audiences. And in spite of massive subsidies for the journalism sector (which is problematic in my view as well for eroding independence from the government), there have been a lot of layoffs over the past ~6 months. Here are some other links on this general theme:\nOn the general topic of free speech, Nate Silver and Niall Ferguson have worthwhile things to say.\nLike Canadian journalism, academia seems like a troubled sector at the moment:\nWhat could possibly go wrong as institutions of knowledge squander and erode trust that was built up over centuries right when a new technology (i.e. LLMs) can generate reams of plausible-sounding text—that better be fact-checked before you use it for anything important?\nOn the topic of AI, the tool I've gotten the best use out of so far has been Bing Copilot for quickly collecting and summarizing information that would previously have taken multiple web searches. The following table is a good example of this: I told Copilot the information I was looking for, and how I wanted it presented. Note that the instruction to sort in ascending order was not followed in spite of the response saying it is sorted—an example of how LLM results are not fully reliable—nor have I fact-checked the temperatures (however, they seem reasonable to me). As part of my writing theme on Industry for 2024, I wanted to explore how the ability to make hotter furnaces or kilns could unlock new materials and processes throughout history. This table illustrates how pottery and objects of precious metal would easily be produced in the Bronze Age (and even the Copper Age). In contrast, glass and steel required higher temperatures than those necessary to enter the Iron Age. Distilling, on the other hand, would have been possible, but to the best of my knowledge, it was unknown in the Classical world.\nWhile we're on the subject of materials and industry: Plastics. Also machine tools. And on a further AI note, here's a graph of the resources that have to go into training these models.\nOn a completely different computing topic, origami computers are apparently a thing.\nFor Christmas, I got a book of photographs by Edward Burtynsky. He does a lot of landscape photography of productive and extractive landscapes, factories, and construction sites. Often, the angle they're taken at doesn't show the horizon (or it's very high at least), and some works have striking geometry and bold colour such that they look like abstract paintings at first glance. The impact/imprint of humanity is a common theme. I enjoy looking at these pictures, both the overall image and some of the fine details. I find they give a strong impression of negentropy. Here are a few examples:\nThis (along with a book I read this winter called Material World—hopefully I'll have a chance to write about it a bit later this year) made me revisit and further develop an idea I mentioned towards the end of this post. Consider some of the most complex modern artifacts like oil refineries and computer chips. They have very high packing densities, fitting hundreds of kilometers of pipe or billions of transistors and other components into a compact area. Visually and conceptually, they're reminiscent of space-filling curves (e.g. Hilbert); linear features (i.e. pipes and circuits in these examples) indeed end up with a fractal dimension that's probably closer to 2 than to 1. (We could also find examples at higher dimensions, like packing a lot of usable surface area into 3D space). These things are fractal-like in some ways, but not perfect/regular fractals. The fact that they're aperiodic makes them incompressible in an information sense. These highly specific and ordered arrangements of matter are local concentrations of negentropy (total entropy in the system still increases, of course, as both of these examples export a lot of entropy) that can bring a lot of order to bear on their inputs: separating crude oil into numerous constituent products, and sorting or doing other calculations on data. This observation generalizes really well: a compact yet ordered packing of a linear feature suggests a really productive locality. Other examples that have come to mind are the dense road networks of major cities, the windings of copper coils in generators, and even DNA (over 2 m is packed into the nucleus of each of our cells). Even something like terracing reflects this, as it greatly increases the usable flat surface area.\nWe've now reached the section of this post where I wanted to share some thought-provoking essays.\n(This covers some of the same ground that I tried to touch on in this post).\nFinally, some random stuff that didn't fit anywhere else:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I only found out last year (at the Water Chair 3oth reunion) that I had one.\nAn Erdős number is a measure of someone's degree of separation from the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős. Coauthorship on the same peer-reviewed paper counts as a link. A related concept is the \"degrees of Kevin Bacon\" in the domain of film, linking actors that have appeared in the same movies. Small world networks and graph theory are topics that I've written about before on this blog.\nLast summer I attended the 30th year anniversary of the research group where I did my master's degree. There was a guest speaker there, Dr. Bruce Rittmann, who is a very prolific scholar in the field of water and wastewater treatment. He's collaborated with my supervisor before. On a whim, I decided to check if he has a defined Erdős number. He does: 5. That gives my supervisor a number of 6 and me (and any other students of Dr. Huck who have co-authored papers with him and don't have a shorter collaboration path to Erdős) a number of 7.\nThe path of linkages is thus: Paul Erdős, Persi W. Diaconis, Ofer Zeitouni, Sigurd B. Angenent, David L. Chopp, Bruce E. Rittmann, Peter M. Huck, Daniel B. Scott.\n(While I was looking stuff up for this post, I found that my Dad has an Erdős number of 6. This is because he co-authored a paper with his supervisor from grad school, who has a number of 5.)\nI decided to track down an article from each link in the chain and comment on them here. For some co-authors, there were multiple papers and I chose one (or two) that looked interesting. Some of these papers only had the abstract available, whereas for others I was able to read the whole thing.\nTo start with, I've previously noted on this blog when a couple of papers with Dr. Huck as one of the authors were published:\nNext is the collaboration between Dr. Huck and Dr. Rittmann:\nBruce E. Rittmann , Peter M. Huck & Edward J. Bouwer (1989) Biological treatment of public water supplies, Critical Reviews in Environmental Control, 19:2, 119-184, DOI: 10.1080/10643388909388362\nThis is a long review paper. Unfortunately, I only have access to the abstract; I wish I could read the whole thing to see how far my field has progressed in my lifetime. It's about strategies to avoid or minimize regrowth in drinking water via biological treatment. It seems to mainly deal with biofilm-related methods (as opposed to suspended growth). They also review methods for measuring low concentrations of biodegradable organic matter (BOM). Finally, they examine some trends in technology and regulations—I'd like to see how accurate their vision of the future was.\nI read two papers with Dr. Rittmann and Dr. Chopp as coauthors since those works were squarely in my current professional interests:\nBrian Merkey, Bruce E. Rittmann, David L. Chopp (2006). \"A Multi-Species, Multi-Component Biofilm Model\".\nB.V. Merkey, B.E. Rittmann, D.L. Chopp (2009). Modelling how SMP support heterotrophic bacteria in autotroph-based biofilms. Journal of Theoretical Biology. 259:4, 670.\nGetting into the papers that are more purely about mathematics, I have the following notes from reading the abstracts or papers. Some of them were fairly far outside my previous experience, so I might have only gotten the bare basics of what they were about:\nS. Argenent, T. Ilmanen, D.L. Chopp (1995). A computed example of non-uniqueness of mean curvature flow in R3. Commun. in Partial Diff. Eq. 20:11&12: 1937-1958.\nThis paper only had a 1-page preview (not even an abstract) available. Apparently, they're trying to answer a question about non-uniqueness (thus a single example will suffice) of mean curvature flow. From the title, it's in a 3-dimensional space of real numbers. Mean curvature flow follows the differential equation,\n∂x / ∂t = H(x)\nHere, x is a point on a manifold/surface in a family of surfaces moving in a defined way and H(x) is the mean curvature vector of the surface at point x. H(x) is the sum of the product of each eigenvalue (2 for a surface in 3-space) with the unit normal vector at x.\nS. Angenent, A. Tannebaum, A. Yezzi Jr., O. Zeitouni (2006). Curve shortening and interacting particle systems. Statistics and Analysis of Shapes, p. 303-311.\nThis is a book chapter, and only the first 2 pages were available as a free preview. Per the abstract, applications of \"curvature driven flows\" of the type they were studying include crystal growth and flame propagation. Apparently, they use semilinear diffusion equations and present a stochastic approximation, but that's about all I was able to glean. Between the previous paper and this one, I was exposed to the concept of curve-shortening flow.\nPersi Diaconis, E. Mayer-Wolf, Ofer Zeitouni, M.P.W. Zerner (2004). The Poisson-Dirichlet Law is the Unique Invariant Distribution for Uniform Split-Merge Transformations. Annals of Probability. 32:18: 915.\nPersi Diaconis and Paul Erdős (1977). Technical Report #12: On the distribution of the greatest common divisor.\nAs my notes surely make clear, I was getting far out of my wheelhouse as these papers got away from water and wastewater treatment. However, it was an interesting exercise tracing the chain of papers back to Paul Erdős and I got exposed to a few new equations and concepts along the way.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Aiming for the proverbial ten-thousand foot view both in terms of geography and categories.\nWhat do we mean when we talk about Industry? In this post (and others on the same theme that I have planned for this year), I'm using \"Industry\" in its narrower sense. So not an economic sector (e.g. the hospitality industry) but rather the transformation of raw materials to finished products (with the complexity of the modern economy there can be several stages of intermediate products). Such transformations require the input of energy—considerable amounts of thermal energy for many industries, especially the most fundamental ones—and the application of knowledge. Industry also implies large scale production and coordination of effort, in contrast to artisanal modes of production. Industrial facilities are commonly called plants, mills, factories, or works; these facilities represent large investments, generally have a large demand for labour, and often accrete a whole ecosystem of supporting services around them (crane rental businesses, welding contractors, commercial laboratories, stores selling PPE, hotels for travelling service technicians, etc.).\nOne of the things I find very interesting about my job doing industrial wastewater treatment is the exposure it provides to a wide variety of industries. I'm seeing them from the back/effluent end as it were, but you can still learn a lot that way. Over the past ~dozen years I've visited plants from multiple industries (primarily but not exclusively in the Food or Ag-Processing sectors), and picked up some odds and ends about several others from working on proposals or reports.\nBased on this experience, near the end of 2023 I thought it would be fun to make a series of #ELI5 / \"How It's Made\"-style videos with my oldest child showing how wastewater gets generated from a variety of production processes. She's still a toddler so there's parts she understood better than others, but I'll enjoy rewatching these videos with her and the rest of my family occasionally over the years as they ask questions about what I do for a living.\nA lot of people associate industry with pollution. I'd contend that they are not inseparable companions. Certainly in my own field of wastewater treatment there has been great progress over the past several decades; Boston Harbor, for example, couldn't be the subject of a novel like Zodiac anymore. Improvements in air quality also shouldn't be taken for granted. The following screenshot from Windy.com shows carbon monoxide levels across much of Asia from earlier this month (similar trends are visible for NO2 and SO2 as well, but I went with CO since it was the most dramatic). The cursor is over the Dhanbad - Bokaro - Jamshedpur triangle in Jharkhand, India. This is not the worst area on the map, but it is a well-defined hotspot so I could figure out what's there. This area is a major centre of steel production in India, along with some other mining and heavy industry. By contrast, if you check air quality indicators across North America, no industrial clusters look anything close to this (sometimes forest fires do); I specifically checked Gary, Indiana (the largest integrated steel mill in North America) and Sarnia, Ontario (major hub of refineries and chemical plants) and their carbon monoxide levels don't stand out from other cities or the surrounding countryside. This goes to show that it is possible to responsibly treat or abate most emissions (water, air, noise) from industry.\nThere are various ways to classify industries. This index template from Wikipedia is pretty decent. As noted in the previous paragraph, this post will focus on the Industrial sector; the Natural sector listed above is the source of the raw materials that get used and transformed in various ways.\nThe Light Industry category includes Food & Beverage production and packaging, Clothing and other textiles, Machining and other fabrication methods, among other things. There's another category for electrical, electronic, and optical devices, along with their components—intermediate products are very important in this category. The Chemical category includes things like the refining of fossil fuels, synthesis or purification of other important chemicals (e.g. fertilizers), and pharmaceuticals. The Materials category is quite broad ranging from wood products (lumber and pulp & paper), to plastics, to glass, to cement, and to metals. Heavy Industry mainly comprises machinery and vehicles in this categorization scheme on Wikipedia.\nSome other categories or distinctions that I think are useful are:\nThere are also classification systems like NAICS and ISIC that are used for official statistics. But my aim here is to discuss the territory not the map.\nThis section is based on an economic atlas that I shared in my last Links post. You can view the data on this site in so many different ways: by country, by product, on a map, on a time-series; the visualization and filtering tools are very good and I highly recommend playing around with it if this kind of stuff interests you at all. The data I'm using is from 2021 (the most recent year available at the time of writing). Some of the percentages mentioned might sound small at first, but keep in mind that 1% (or even less) is still a huge amount when considering total trade volumes in the hundreds of billions or even low trillions of dollars per year. I've selected the countries based on places I've been before (Germany was the shortest, with only an afternoon walking around Hamburg) but feel that this actually provides decent coverage.\nMostly I won't discuss the service sector, although this atlas does show it. It is in the lead for most countries discussed below. Note also that these statistics are all for exports (plus some discussion of imports in the case of Canada). Total production will be higher since some things are also made for domestic consumption, so what gets exported tends to be what a country has a competitive advantage in producing and is also conducive for shipping (services are actually quite challenging to export, for example, so the domestic service sector will certainly be bigger than what's shown in the charts I'm getting this data from).\nI expect the entries below to be informative not only about where things are made (and where some raw materials are sourced) but also about what are some of the largest and most significant global industries (i.e. the ones that get mentioned really frequently).\nThe list starts with Canada and then goes in alphabetical order.\nCanada: You can really see that natural resources are the strongest part of Canada's export economy. This includes minerals and metals, along with agricultural (which includes silviculture/forestry and fisheries/aquaculture in the way the data is presented here) products. Some are unprocessed (crude oil and mineral ores, for example) and others have had at least some processing (e.g. refined oil, sawn lumber, unwrought aluminum). The largest advanced manufacturing sector is automotive: adding up cars, motor vehicle parts, piston engines, commercial vehicles, and related categories gets over 7%. Finally, a few individual squares I thought were notable include: potash fertilizer (1%), crustaceans (0.65%), copper wire (0.3%), and peat and cement (0.1% each).\nFor Canada, I'll also discuss imports. The machinery sector (including computers at 1.6%) is notably larger than it is for exports. Chemical/pharmaceutical is a bit bigger. Textiles is not especially high in the import ranking, but it was dead last for exports. The cars/vehicles category is quite interesting as it is a very similar magnitude for imports and exports; this shows how integrated the North American auto-sector is, with vehicles in various stages of completion crossing the Ambassador Bridge (and hopefully the Gordie Howe bridge too next year) in both directions. The category 'Transmission apparatus for radio, telephone and TV' is where cellphones are counted so it is a prominent item for many countries and Canada's 1.7% is no exception.\nBrazil: They are even more of a natural resources economy than Canada. As far as exports are concerned—I know they do have a lot of industry serving domestic consumption—a lot of the major products have minimal processing. Soya beans and iron ore both jump out (over 10% each), for example. Sugarcane (3%), coffee (1.7%), and meat (over 5% spread across a few kinds) are other major contributors. One well-known Brazilian company doing advanced manufacturing is Embraer and aircraft show up at 0.7%.\nDenmark: Transport makes up 27% of Denmark's exports (with much of this due to the shipping giant Maersk). I haven't been discussing the service sector for other countries, but global shipping is very relevant to industrial supply chains, so I thought I'd mention this one. Denmark is also home to the pharmaceutical company Nova Nordisk that makes the weight loss drug Ozempic and the impact of this company shows up with 'packaged medicaments' being 5.8% of exports—and this has likely increased since 2021. In a small country like Denmark (not quite 6 million people), a couple of global-profile companies can make a huge difference. With Scandinavia being known for their furniture design it's fitting that seats and other furniture add up to over 1% of exports. Electrical generators and transformers also add up to over 1%. Apparently Denmark also has a large pork industry.\nFrance: The pharmaceutical sector is large here. Agriculture is also very prominent for such an advanced economy; the largest contributor to that is wine, which does involve some processing. 'Aircraft and spacecraft' stand out at 3.6% (Airbus, based in Toulouse, is the notable company here); gas turbines at 1.4% presumably includes a lot of jet engines. France also exports a decent amount of energy, in the form of electricity (0.9%).\nGermany: The two biggest non-service sectors of German exports are Machinery and Chemicals. Cars are big too, of course, at 6.8%. Both categories are pretty diverse, although the chemical category contains a strong pharmaceutical component. 'Machines not elsewhere classified' is at 1%, which really fits Germany's reputation of making the machines that make other machines; centrifuges alone are at 0.8% and even the very specific sub-category of 'machinery for the industrial preparation of food or drink' is over 0.1%.\nMorocco: Morocco has a few categories of fertilizers accounting for over 14% of their exports. I'd heard before that they were one of the main places where phosphates are mined, so that makes sense. Fruits, vegetables, and seafood are other big exports for them. They have a relatively large textile sector compared to most of the other countries on this list. An interesting item is insulated electrical wire, with 3.2 billion in annual exports compared to 0.7 billion in annual imports of copper wire. This is a good example of globalized supply chains: bare wire gets made somewhere, gets bundled/insulated somewhere else, then exported again to be used (or incorporated into other intermediate products). I wasn't aware that they had an automotive industry, but apparently they export cars, too (I found after searching about this that Renault does some manufacturing there).\nNetherlands: The Netherland's largest non-service export sector is chemicals (pharmaceuticals plus some industrial chemicals) with a diverse machinery sector close behind. This part looks quite a bit like the German economy. Agriculture is big in the Netherlands as well; cut flowers and live plants contribute 1.2%. They have a decent amount of North Sea oil and gas, too.\nOne notable example of a global chain of industries is cutting-edge semiconductor fabrication. A single company in the Netherlands (ASML) makes machines that can engrave circuits on silicon chips with extreme UV (EUV) light, achieving unprecedented precision. They get their optics from a single company in Germany (Zeiss) and a company in Taiwan (TSMC) have so far been the ones to use to its full potential (although if I understand correctly, Samsung and Intel are not far behind). This shows up in the global statistics: in 2021, \"Apparatus and equipment for photographic laboratories, not elsewhere classified\" (the category for photolithography) shows up as 4.46% of Taiwan's imports, 2.18% of South Korea's imports, and 1.84% of the Netherlands' exports.\nSpain: Agriculture is their biggest non-service sector. Pork (Jamón ibérico presumably counting for a lot of this) at 1.25% is the largest, followed by citrus fruit (0.8%) and olive oil (0.7%). Aside from the fresh fruit, there'd be some processing involved. What surprised me looking at their chart was pharmaceuticals and cars being so prominent as I can't think of any specific Spanish companies making those off the top of my head.\nUK: Their service sector comprises a large proportion of exports. After that, machinery is prominent; it looks pretty diverse with gas turbines (jet engines from Rolls-Royce being part of this, I presume) counting for 4.5%. Pharmaceuticals and other chemical industries are also a large contributor, along with cars at 6.3%. Liquor is at 1.65%—I expect a lot of this is whisky. Precious metals are also very prominent--over 10% between gold and platinum—but they show up in imports in similar quantities so my guess is that this represents activities like casting bars and minting bullion, or maybe it's just about providing a venue for the physical settlement of precious metal trades. The UK also has some North Sea oil and gas.\nUS: I'm not sure that a lot of people realize that the US is a net exporter of oil and gas now but these comprise over 8% of exports. They have large machinery and chemical/pharmaceutical sectors. Cars and integrated circuits are also significant exports at over 2% each. Notable agricultural exports include soya beans (1.1%) and corn (0.75%).\nYemen: Over half of their exports are crude oil, and the second highest category is scrap metal.\nI've never been there, but you can't write about this topic without mentioning China. Electronics jump out as their largest export (smartphones, computers, etc.). 'Toys' is at 1.2% and 'other articles of plastic' is at 0.95%. Textiles are also a significant category. Their imports, by contrast, include a lot of raw materials or intermediate products. Iron ore, crude oil, and integrated circuits are all at 5% or higher. Even plastic inputs for manufacturing are significant: polymers of ethylene, styrene, and propylene add up to 1%. India is also informative to look at. They are much more diversified in their exports than their neighbours like Pakistan or Bangladesh, who mainly have textiles.\nTo wrap this up, here are some interesting factoids and links for further reading on this topic:\nPermalink",

    "content": "My customary annual retrospective.\nThe past year has been very good on a personal level, with a growing family and increasing responsibilities at work. As far as this blog is concerned, I now have a decade under my belt! This year, I wrote 11 posts (counting this one), which is close to my goal of averaging one per month. This has been my target for the past several years (2020, 2021, 2022, and now 2023); prior to that was a different season of life when I had more time to write—I need to go back and fix a bunch of archive links so those earlier posts are more accessible when I get a chance.\nHere is the list of my posts from this year:\nOne of my goals in 2023 was to read five books of 500+ pages: Lord of the Rings, Growth by Vaclav Smil, The Monkey and the Monk (an abridged version of Journey to the West), City of God (also abridged), and Champlain's Dream. As the year ends, I'm about 75% of the way through the final one and expect to finish it a week or two into the new year. Stay tuned for reviews (probably including another set of mini-reviews) and quotes/excerpts I'll share inspired by this reading—which was not all I read this year; in total I read 14 books.\nOne of my favourite posts from the past year was inspired in part by a passage from Lord of the Rings. It also relates to industry and modes of production, which I'm planning to have as a theme for some of my writing and reading in 2024 (I have some outlines in mind for at least 2 or 3 posts).\nThe following comment is something I wrote on Facebook back in October with my understanding on what is going on in the world. Earlier in 2023 I had written a post considering some possible scenarios for geopolitical realignment and those ideas have continued to bounce around in my mind. Even after writing this comment, events have continued to occur—notably sabre-rattling by Venezuela against Guyana and the Houthis in Yemen targetting ships sailing up the Red Sea.\nI make no pretense of knowing how all this will shake out, but the events of 2023 have increased my expectation that various players that feel ambitious or embattled could try something in the coming year(s). Buckle up, I guess.\nI've really been enjoying this song since it came out. Not only is it catchy, but I feel it has a lot of relevance, especially the poignant lines \"I thought to make a broadsword / for fighting on the field / much as I know the hammer is a nobler thing to wield / for though us humble tradesfolk / choose a quiet life / the gods of war come to the door / of the hammer and his wife\". I suspect the relationship between industrial capacity and \"politics by other means\" will be a very salient trend in the year(s) ahead. Like, the US has clearly recognized that compute is a strategic resource and is trying to develop as much domestic semiconductor fab capacity as possible before an Incident occurs that would block access to (or destroy) overseas production. Munitions production lines are also being spun back up. (Canadian politics is a lot more naive, and I haven't seen much sign of strategic thinking in our industrial policy yet). Anyway, these thoughts are part of the reason (it was already a subject of interest for me anyway) I believe themes of technology and industry will be useful/productive to continue reading, thinking, and writing about in the year ahead.\nAlong with this theme that I intend to have as a common thread through a few posts in 2024, I have plans (and in some cases an outline or a partial draft) for a number of other posts spanning the typical range of things I like to write about. So check back monthly (he says, optimistically) or even subscribe. Happy New Year!\nPermalink",

    "content": "Alternate title: A Tale of Two Tables (or perhaps Tables of the Elements)\nThis post is a write-up of a couple of DIY projects I did this year. The first one was a fibreglass water table for my 2-year-old daughter to play in with water toys outside. The second was a patio fire table (fueled by natural gas).\nThe water table was my first time applying fibreglass, and one of my goals for this project (aside from having a usable water table at the end of it) was to learn how to do so—in the long-term, I'd like to develop this skill to the point that I can try boat-building. I built the structure from 2x4s and a left-over piece of OSB. The table dimensions are 1.5' x 4'. There is a PVC pipe protruding through the wall at one end to provide a drain; it was also intended to provide a wet well for a circulation pump, but that part didn't work so well.\nHere are a couple of photos of the water table, both while I was applying the fibreglass and the finished version:\nIn the photo on the right, some bubbles and wrinkles in the fibreglass are readily apparent. Not only did this make the inside less smooth than I had hoped (although the sharp edges I was able to file down for safety no problem), it also wasn't water-tight. I ended up doing 4 or 5 coats of fibreglass, but there was still some dripping. What eventually worked was injecting some expanding insulating foam through holes I drilled at the site of each leak. Unfortunately, this also clogged up the PVC drain I had fabricated, since the joint between the pipe penetration and the fibreglass was one of the areas that wasn't well sealed initially.\nIt would have been nice if the drain had worked, because a table with standing water outside attracted insect larvae and needed to be drained and refilled frequently to get rid of them.\nThere was a little electric pump that I had made a battery pack for (see the photo below) that was intended to sit in the wet well. That part didn't end up being used according to my original design because of the flow to the PVC pipe being blocked, but the pump still ended up being a fun part of playing in the water table this summer—in fact, my daughter took to calling the whole thing her \"pump table\".\nThis was definitely a learning experience for me as far as applying fibreglass goes. I could have watched some tutorial videos first, but in the long run I think it's more educational to take a crack at something yourself, then compare to best practices as a form of trouble-shooting. In retrospect, I should have done some sealing (with caulking or body filler) before adding the first coat of fibreglass. Here are some other lessons I learned (from this experience and from watching some videos afterwards):\nFor next summer, my plan is to try to rebuild a water table taking these lessons into account with my fibreglassing technique. I also have a couple of other design changes in mind: making it smaller so an adult can easily lift and dump it and a drain isn't required; have a solar-powered mini-pump instead of one with batteries (that battery pack got full of rust, in spite of attempts to seal it).\nIn spite of the challenges with making it water-tight, this made for an enjoyable play-zone so I'm glad I made it!\nThe patio fire table was also a satisfying project but I don't recommend trying to make one yourself unless you know what you're doing due to the risks involved. I've worked with gas equipment occasionally as part of my job so I went into this with some prior experience.\nHere are a couple of photos of the fire table I built:\nThe legs are made of 1/2\" copper pipe, and are 20\" tall (plus the height added by two elbows and a tee). The table has a wooden base with a 10\" x 14\" hole cut into it; it is topped with marble tiles and has some heavy-gauge aluminum foil tacked around the inner edges to reflect heat away from the wood. There is a mesh basket holding some black stones sitting in the middle, and another board holding the D-stem control knob (and supporting the rest of the gas train on the reverse side) on the front. Fuel comes via a 3/8\" natural gas hose (my house has an exterior natural gas connection on the back deck).\nThe components in the gas train are shown in the following photos. It consists of a pressure regulator (1/2\" FPT thread, 4\" W.C. NG pressure), a gas control valve (3/8\" MIP thread, 1.75 mm orifice) and a couple of brass fittings to connect everything together. The orifice leaving the control valve is inserted into a barbecue burner tube.\nAs seen in the previous set of photos, it worked. The first moment of ignition was exciting! The flame in the photo is yellow (which is cozier, and also more visible for safety), but I was also able to get a blue flame. There is an air shutter on the burner tube that can pre-mix air via a venturi effect, and the air:fuel ratio affects the flame colour. Doing this project provided some motivation to read up a bit on flame dynamics, so I have some links to share that explain some of the theory behind gas burners.\nPermalink",

    "content": "During the pandemic, among other books, I got around to reading some classics that had been on my list for some time: Plato's Republic, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, and Pascal's Pensées. Timeless works like those are hard to say anything new about, so this isn't a review; this post is simply a collection of notes and quotes I wanted to have available for future reference.\nThere is an introduction to Athanasius' On The Incarnation (another worthwhile classic work that I've read recently, thanks to the encouragement of online/forum/blog book discussions) by C.S. Lewis that says,\nAs the kids say, can confirm.\nHe goes on give the following advice to read old books:\nThese are definitely old books. Plato's Republic was written around 375 BC, Marcus Aurelius' Meditations were written in the years leading up to A.D. 180, and Pascal's Pensées were published in 1669.\nIn each of the following sections, I'll share some notes I took from these works and some quotes that stood out to me. Please pardon the terse/point-form nature of this post. Or consider it as a snapshot of my writing process, since this type of notes is how most of my book review posts start out. And I deliberately decided that fleshing these notes out into a set of full reviews was far too large in scope.\nThe Republic was a book I found well worth reading. It has been so influential over the millennia that many parts had some familiarity, but getting them in the original form was cool. And in places it's even quite funny.\nAnd here are some selected excerpts with further notes/discussion:\nSocrates makes \"no true Scotsman\" arguments like this a fair bit. That is, to the extent someone doesn't live up to the ideal of his or her role, they aren't considered to truly be that role (e.g. a leader). Here the ideal is leadership in the interest of one's subjects:\nDiscussion of the perfectly just man (p.54, book II), who must continue to be just while being thought the most unjust so that there is no ulterior motive or external reward/incentive for his justice:\nThe poets setting a bad example for the youth. World view matters, and the stories about the Greek gods give the impression that it is better to get rich (by fair means or foul) and offer sacrifices than to be just your whole life but have nothing to offer the gods:\nOutline (book II, p. 61)—considering justice first in the State to better understand it in the individual:\nDiscussion of comparative advantage and specialization and gains from trade, p. 62:\nThe nature of God, from logical first principles ('that of which nothing is greater'):\n(Of course, the Greek gods are very changeable (both in form, being wont to go in disguise, and in character, being rather capricious), and he criticizes the poets for this).\nChoose your role models well (p.87)—really there is so much in here about the education of the youths, especially future leaders\n(a lot of the length of the Republic comes from it being a dialogue, but most of the characters aside from Socrates have typical lines of \"Yes, certainly\" or \"Very right\".)\nDiscussion of medicine and how the upper classes have too much leisure:\nVirtuous members of the artisanal class ask the doctor for a \"rough and ready cure\" and afterwards such a person \"either gets well and lives and does his business, or if his constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.\" But the rich are prone to seeking constant care for every little physical complaint and even veer into hypochondria\n\"Such excessive care of the body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastics, is most inimical to the practice of virtue.\" (p.99)\nChoose your entertainment well (Book IV, p.115):\nJustice = internal unity and harmony (p.134, book IV):\nHe's very big on a place for everyone and everyone in his proper place, both in society, and within a man (keeping reason, spirit and urges/passions/appetites in their proper order)\nP. 188:\nHow the philosophers should write the constitution of their state, p. 188:\nContemplation of the ideal forms comes first; empiricism or inductive reasoning is not his way\np.152 has a passage reminiscent of 1 Cor 12:\nMentions reluctant rulers being the best, and the responsibility of those who have seen the truth to go back down into the cave and help others\np.213, Book VII:\n\"Discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense\" (p.217)\nDanger of getting disillusioned with the values you were raised with without discovering new ones to take their place. p.224 continues to discuss the danger of excessive skepticism, nihilism, deconstruction:\n(so teach dialectic/argument/rhetoric after students have gained wisdom and maturity)\np.228, matching up 5 types of states to 5 types fo people: aristocratic (good), contentious/ambitious (like Sparta), Oligarchical (pre-revolutionary), democratic (assumed to follow from a revolution, and tyrannical (when the chaos of democracy makes people crave a strong leader)\np.239 trouble in oligarchy (such a good match for student loans!)\np.242, Democracy: (he doesn't believe everyone is intrinically equal)\nRemember the discussion of the State is paralleled with the discussion of the individual soul. The criticisms of democracy are applied to basically say don't give all your desires a democratic vote; the man who corresponds to democracy is internally ungoverned/unruly.\np. 247, Book VIII, more criticism of democracy (anarchy because democracy's focus on equality diminishes hierarchies that are good and proper): (c.f Confucius' 5 relationships)\n(it also talks about too much equality between citizens and non-citizens, old and young, slave and free, men and women\nOn that same page, the pendulum theory of politics:\nI don't think he's against freedom and equality, they just aren't his ultimate values, so he's adamant that they be kept in balance, not in excess\nRise of a tyrant, p.251:\n(many such cases throughout history)\np.262-263 in Book IX, getting close to conclusion; contrasts the happiness of the just with the misery of the tyrant who can't control himself\np.273 continues in this theme:\nBe rightly governed internally, with every part of your nature in its proper role\np.275 makes this more explicit:\nThis might mean avoiding wealth and honour that is likely to disorder one's soul (e.g. not going into politics unless your own State is compatible enough with the ideal City/Republic described herein)\np.275, about the ideal City existing as a Platonic form:\n(Obvious City of God tie-in is obvious)\nDiscussion in Book X (or maybe end of Book IX) of forms, specific instances, and images of them (example is the Ideal Bed, a bed made by a carpenter, a painting of a bed)\nRight at the end, he drops a bombshell that he believes in the immortal soul, p.290:\nThe general themes of Aurelius' Meditations include:\nMarcus Aurelius was a keen observer of the natural world. For example, book 8 includes observations about how matter gets recycled by natural processes of decay, and how rays of sun extend out in straight lines, illuminating what they touch.\nIt is pretty repetitive. He keeps returning to the same themes, looking to remind himself as much as anyone (note that it wasn't originally written for an audience).\nHere are some notes I took from the Introduction to my volume (regarding Stoic doctrines):\nHere are some excerpts that stood out to me:\nBook 2.14:\np.32 urges to identify what we perceive accurately and \"to call it by its name\" (echoes of Confucius). Everything has its proper place, as \"a citizen of that higher city, of which all other cities are mere households.\" (echoes of Plato and St. Augustine)\nBook 4.7-8 (against victimhood):\nBook 4.43:\nBook 5.23:\nStart of Book 5: admonishment to get out of bed!\nShort snippets from Book 5:\nStoicism is a philosophy, but it is also an attitude. An attitude the modern world could use more of, probably.\np.70 (6.9-10) has conflicting views on whether the material world is all there is.\nBook 6.15:\n(c.f. Psalm 90)\nObstructing and thwarting things is also a role the world needs (6?.42)\nSome Science-related Observations:\np.88 on thermodynamics:\np.111 (8.50) on nutrient cycles: (also in 9.35)\nBook 7.49-50, very reminiscent of Ecclesiastes\nSummary of stoic teaching: (9.31)\nBut why does justice matter given other parts of the Stoic worldview? Kind of incoherent with the view that acquiescense is the right response to bad things happening. Or if not incoherent, at least asymmetric (your own character and good behaviour matter, but you can't expect that of others).\nPeak Stoic (p.132):\nThoughts on theodicy, spoken like an emperor\nAnd uncertainty regarding the Ultimate: (p.164, 12.14)\nPascal's Pensées was actually written as notes for a book that he didn't live to complete. But the semi-point-form outline that survives is the length of a decent book in itself.\nHere are some of my notes:\nThemes about apologetics:\nAnd here are some additional notes and excerpts:\nEffective persuasion:\n1.17, on rivers:\nPoetic and profound:\n2.81:\nhe lists several ways our reason is short-circuited and then sums up the epistemological challenge,\nSeveral quotes illustrating our fallen nature. Not in a bombastic manner, but very relatable:\n3.185, importance of free will:\nwrestling with doubt:\nThe famous wager:\nHe quotes \"none can come to the Father but the Son, and those to whom the Son reveals Him\" and explains that Scripture never claims God is obvious. Him being hidden without the eyes of faith is compatible with the claims of the Gospel, a theme he'll return to later.\nKnown unknowns, unknown unknowns, and epistemic humility:\nHe emphasizes that faith is a gift of God, not a gift of reason. It is irrational to rely on reason beyond its proper scope\nOn war:\nInterplay between might and right: (5.298)\nThere is a slight edge of cynicism to this; surrounding passages imply that we shade our sense of right and wrong to align with the powerful, because seeing injustice everywhere and being powerless to stop it breeds cognitive dissonance. For example, he also says,\nBut he is very interested in peace (especially avoiding civil wars) even if it requires compromise. So in his view, legible hierarchies and status markers are preferable to illegible ones that are more meritocratic:\n(legible mechanisms for the peaceful transfer of power (e.g. primogeniture) have an advantage over ones that might be more optimized for the right candidate in theory but have a higher risk of conflict (e.g. Ottoman succession involving fraticide))\nCustom as a Schelling point for social harmony, but needs to be imbued with myth or legal fiction to be sustained. But the truly wise can see that customs may not have anything deeper under them, but follow them anyway out of pragmatism:\nHis evidence that human laws aren't synonymous with ideal justice (definite Plato vibes here) is that they aren't universal across societies while true justice is. However, the pragmatic considerations of societal peace still apply:\nthere are people who see through the law matching true justice, but fail to recognize the importance of having a common ruleset for society:\nThis quote and the subsequent one on attitudes toward authority figures (nobles in his day) make me think of the \"midwit\" meme template.\n(Secret reasons = as a pragmatic way to keep society stable since civil war is awful\npoignant that this was pre-revolution by a bit over a century)\nMoving on from politics,\n(anticipates some of the aspects of a Turing machine)\n6.375 - he distrusts himself, which gradually led to a disillusionment with society being just:\nNeed for an absolute moral standard to judge between competing perspectives on morality:\nThe human condition (6.418 and possibly before):\nApologetics point #1, the Bible accurately describes the two sides of the human condition\nMore echoes of Plato - rightly ordered parts of a person are crucial:\n7.508, wow:\nWatch how you talk to yourself, insightful:\nGod is not obvious in the world, nor can it entirely make sense without Him. This leaves faith as a necessity and leaves room for mystery in religion, both major themes of the apologetic arguments Pascal makes:\nAlso,\nThe Old Testament prophecies of the coming of Christ were not preserved by Christians, but by Jews who interpreted them differently. Therefore, these prophecies can be seen as an external testimony. See 749: \"If the Jews had all been converted by Jesus Christ, we should have none but questionable witnesses. And if they had been entirely destroyed, we should have no witnesses at all.\"\nOT prophecies as a form of Divine pre-registration\nProphecy itself does not claim to be clear to all:\nHis fragmentary summaries of significant prophecies:\nAnother apologetics point: the behaviour of the disciples after Jesus rose and ascended. Not the behaviour of deceivers.\nReligion being almost a human universal suggests that there's something there, in Pascal's view:\nFrom the Appendix:\nOn Free speech:\nPermalink",

    "content": "It's been a year since my last links post. Tried to squeeze this one in while it's still technically summer.  This one has more video content than previous ones.\nI'll start with something I wrote elsewhere: a guest post for an online book club on C.S. Lewis' The Four Loves.\nA few places I've gone earlier this year that are worth sharing:\nGetting into the videos I mentioned above, the first one I wanted to share is of a hydraulic computer. It is more polished than the one I tried to make, but uses a similar principle.\nHere's another video on analogue computers.\nThis one is a good introduction to sediment transport in rivers and Lane's Balance:\nIn this post (about halfway down), I discussed the possibility space for the evolving balance of power between the US and China. You don't have to assume one extreme or the other as an outcome: other possibilities include continuation of the status quo, ossifying spheres of influence, or division and decline afflicting both superpowers. Here's a series of three videos (so far) that get different people's takes on how/whether China will continue to rise as the next superpower:\nI appreciate seeing this testing of different pundits' views against each other. My take on the object-level question is that from my vantage point it looks like every major power is way out over their skis right now: whether financially (debt and unfunded/unsustainable spending commitments, real estate bubbles, etc.); in terms of demographics and skilled workforce availability; in terms of increasing internal division and worsening social cohesion; due to strategic supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g. importing necessities from unstable regions); or some mix of these. Or, in the case of Russia, entangled in a war of attrition that—even if they come out the other side with more territory—will likely take decades to rebuild capacity afterwards. It’s far from clear to me who will blink first.\nThe last video I want to share is one I made, about slide rules:\n(if you like that, check out this post).\nMoving on from videos to articles and other links, on subjects ranging from math to geopolitics.\nThis infographic of the size of national economies is good context to keep in mind. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are now in the trillion-dollar club (of annual GDP). India is now the 5th largest economy in the world, ahead of the UK (the next two spots are Germany and Japan, which are facing major demographic headwinds). Russia is only the 5th largest economy in Europe. Also on the subject of national economies, this interactive atlas to visualize exports and imports is fascinating to play around with, and a very useful reference (I may use it more in a future post I'm thinking of about Industry).\nSpeaking of atlases, a friend wrote this review of a video game atlas.\nHere's some more about what's going on in Canada and the world lately:\nThe Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta are taking some different policy approaches to drug addiction and abuse crises. B.C. is trying, among other things, decriminalization of even hard drugs, while Alberta is emphasizing residential treatment facilities. The rising trends in fatalities from overdoses or toxic drugs have been broadly similar in the two provinces from 2016 to 2022 as seen in the following graphs (e.g. both saw a dip in 2019, then a return to a rising trend), so I'm pre-registering that this is a good natural experiment on these policies. If the trends diverge going forward that would suggest one approach is more effective.\nWater and energy are professional as well as personal interests of mine:\nWhat I'm currently reading is City of God by St. Augustine. This review makes the case for its contemporary relevance. Here are some other links on Christian topics or themes:\nAI/ML is a topic still attracting a lot of interest right now. Here's a couple of articles that focus on the positives, such as possibly improving the news or taking a critical view of some much-publicized risks. Here's an under-the-hood explanation of ChatGPT. But there's also predictions of disruption (albeit potentially creative destruction), and a reminder of the limitations of this technology among the links I have to share. That last one is about how AI has different blindspots than human players in the game of Go (thus is relevant to this post from last year).\nThe previous paragraph is about an area of technology that is moving very quickly right now. It's hard to keep up with all the developments, so establishing general principles for how we interact with technology can be a more effective investment of one's time and attention (that's part of what I was aiming at in this post). So consider \"intentionally selecting which technologies we allow into our lives\".\nA theme I've started thinking more about in the past couple of years (some thoughts along these lines are here, and I have some additional ideas on my list to try to write about next year) is what it takes to keep industrial society running. The challenges of managing complexity, disseminating tacit knowledge, and maintaining systems that no single individual fully understands—that sort of thing. The following links touch on this general theme:\nThis penultimate section contains some resources that may be useful (maybe just to me, but hey!) someday:\nFinally, here are some miscellaneous things that didn't fit in earlier in this post, but I still wanted to share:\nIf you made it all the way to the end, I hope you found something that caught your interest in a worthwhile way.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Last year is well in the rearview mirror by now, but I wanted to compile some of my notes from books I read (and a movie) in 2022 while they're still somewhat in my mind. I did a similar post last year and thought it worked pretty well. Maybe you'll find something that sounds intriguing below; maybe I'll want to refer back to some of the material below in future posts.\nEach book has a separate section below. This overall post is lengthy, but most of the sections are fairly succinct and can stand alone. Which is not to say that there aren't some common threads. There are a couple of books about physics, a couple of Russian novels, and more.\nThese are not all the books I read in 2022. There were a number of novels I read and enjoyed, but didn't think the reviews would fit in this post. There are also several books that have already featured in previous posts:\nThe Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics by Leonard Susskind is a physics book that covers classical mechanics (so a refresher in that sense) but with math tools I hadn't learned before. It went over things I had heard about but not learned the details of, like the Principle of Least Action, Lagrangians, and Hamiltonians. Now, calculus can be hard to follow from reading alone, so I watched some videos also. The combination of reading and watching was effective for learning some of these concepts.\nIn this section, I'll start with some excerpts that stood out to me from reading Susskind's book, then share some additional notes on the concepts he covers that are a mix of what I learned from his book and what I learned from videos that it sparked me to look up and watch.\nThe Theoretical Minimum begins with generalities about dynamical laws. They must be deterministic and reversible. But note that even in deterministic models, perfect predictability is impossible due to the interaction of resolving power of measurements and sensitive dependence on initial conditions (i.e. chaos). It moves on to phase space, where you have coordinates of position and momentum in as many physical dimensions as are needed for the problem (so a total of 6 axes for a particle that can move unconstrained in 3 dimensions; in other words a single particle needs (x,y,z) components of both position and velocity/momentum).  Another concept discussed early on is an energy \"landscape\", where force always pushes down a potential energy gradient.\nThe core of the book introduces Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. The Lagrangian (L) is the difference between kinetic (T) and potential energy (V),\nL = T - V. The integral of the Lagrangian is known as the \"Action\", so the so-called Principle of Least/Stationary Action is about minimizing this quantity. Doing so will define a trajectory through phase space (i.e. it will relate position and momentum and how they can change in concert) for the system in question. The solution to this minimization problem can be found using the Euler-Lagrange equations, as described here (see the end of this subsection for the actual equations):\nIf I understand correctly, the big advantages of the Lagrangian approach compared to analyzing the forces (which is how I was taught mechanics) are that it generalizes more easily to a wide variety of systems and that it allows for picking semi-arbitrary coordinates that define key features of the system. The selection of coordinates is covered in this explanation Susskind gives of the calculation method:\n(The conjugate momentum is the partial derivative of the Langrangian with respect to the generalized velocity (i.e. linear or angular or possibly some other analogue depending on how you selected the coordinates for the system) and the equations will be later in this section).\nAnother useful concept related to the Lagrangian is Symmetries; in this context a Symmetry is \"an active coordinate transformation that does not change the value of the Lagrangian\". Every Symmetry is related to and implies a conservation law. For example, energy conservation is related to symmetry across a shift in time (i.e. picking a different t=0 for your coordinate system doesn't change the overall analysis).\nThe Hamiltonian (H) is closely related to the Lagrangian and is a measure of total energy, kinetic + potential: H = T + V. An important difference when it comes to applying it is that it results in first-order differential equations (albeit twice as many) while the Euler-Lagrange equations are second-order. The Hamiltonian approach works great when you want to keep the differential equations as differential equations rather than integrating them to a single trajectory as a function of time:\nThe Hamiltonian approach can thus be used to map out phase space—at any combination of position and momentum, how will these quantities change moving forward in time? Visualizing things in phase space can allow for a big picture view of the system:\nYou can think of phase space as containing \"contours\" of constant energy. Susskind also suggests thinking of it as being filled with an imaginary fluid:\nThinking of phase space as fluid-filled makes it natural to analyze with math that's often seen in fluid dynamics. The del operator (∇) and the div, grad, and curl operations it is used in come up frequently in the latter part of The Theoretical Minimum. And this is where I'm going to start using some mathematical notation in this review, and also referencing a few videos I watched to increase my understanding of what I was reading about. First of all, here are the links to a few videos I found very helpful in understanding this topic:\nAnd here are some of the equations and related notes from a mix of these videos and Susskind's book:\nDay of the Oprichnik by Vladimir Sorokin was recommended by Bruno Maçães in Dawn of Eurasia. It's a Russian novel from 2011—actually it seems that is when it was translated into English, and in fact it was originally written half a decade earlier, which makes some of the details kind of eerie. The most valuable thing about this novel, in my opinion, are some of the details of the setting and the fact that a Russian author found them plausible enough for near-future sci-fi (which, to be fair, is not a super high bar for plausibility) almost twenty years ago. It is not an enjoyable novel, or one that I would necessarily recommend. It is written as a day in the life* of a very unpleasant man working for a very unpleasant organization. Some of the violence and sexual content I found gratuitous, especially the ending. But as I said, the setting is the most interesting part, so that's what I'll focus on in this review.\nThe Oprichnina was apparently a real organization under Ivan the Terrible, a sort of secret police / internal espionage. Their symbols were a dog's head to sniff out treachery/disloyalty and a broom to sweep it away. In Day of the Oprichnik, Russia has a Tsar again and he has reconstituted the Oprichnina. They mount brooms and severed dogs' heads on their luxury cars as they drive around because they're the sort of secret police who are meant to be seen. Instilling terror via extra-judicial executions with significant ritual or performative aspects is a big part of what they do. The need to use terror to keep the population, especially the nobility, in line is because the Russia of this novel is a paranoid country that has cut itself off from the rest of the world.\nThis scene from early in the novel when the main character is watching the morning news drops several clues about the setting:\nRussia has literally walled itself off from most of the rest of the world (although is dependent on a rising China). Oil and gas pipelines are regularly used as tools of geopolitical leverage. Profanity is banned and corporal punishment is meted out for a variety of infractions.\nThe goings-on with walls and pipelines are not seen directly, but are effectively illustrated by having the main character meet with other censors to review a stage play in Moscow about them:\nThere is also a part where the main character compares a drug-induced high to the feeling \"like you’ve been at a resort in our sunny Crimea.\" Note that Crimea was very much a part of Ukraine at the time this was written. I don't get the impression that the author is in favour of this, but an expansionist yet extremely isolationist and paranoid country is the picture he chooses to paint of a near-future Russia.\nAnother feature of the setting is that China's efforts to build a new Silk Road (一带一路) have come to fruition:\nThe main theme of Day of the Oprichnik is that the main character and his comrades are corrupt and engaging in all the vices they punish others for.\nPowers And Thrones: A New History Of The Middle Ages by Dan Jones is a good overview of a large swath of European history (and some bordering regions). Because it is an overview, it is hard to summarize—it is necessarily more broad and less detailed than, say, Lotharingia. Reading it in 2022, the part about a pandemic (i.e. the Black Death) and the social disruptions it wrought stood out so that's what I'll focus on in this mini-review. However, that part was only a chapter or two out of the whole book.\nThe scope of Powers and Thrones is basically the Middle Ages in Europe, bookended from one sack of Rome (410) to another (1527). Geographically it spreads out more than most histories of medieval Europe, considering also the Arab World and the Mongols (primarily at their points of interaction with Europe, but providing a decent amount of background leading up to that).\nOne of the five 500+ pages books I'm trying to read this year (a goal I've alluded to before) is City of God. So I'll share Dan Jones' description to whet your appetite (going on the assumption that I'll eventually get around to writing a post based on reading it):\nThe chapters of Powers and Thrones mostly deal with specific themes or trends, arranged roughly in chronological order (although there is unavoidable overlap). These themes/trends include: Monasticism (Cluny and then Citeaux spreading their reforms), Knights, Castles, Early Universities, Rise of merchants and the middle class, etc. As I mentioned above, in this review I'll focus on the part about the Black Death and its aftermath. For this, I'll mostly let Dan Jones' words speak for themselves:\nIn summary, famine and plague in the 14th century led to a lot of rebellions and eventual social changes.\nFinally, this line about conflict arising from a proliferation of new channels of communication/information had a ring of relevance to it:\nEinstein's Fridge: How the Difference Between Hot and Cold Explains the Universe by Paul Sen basically retreads the history of thermodynamics, explaining a lot of the science along the way. It is written at a more popular level than The Theoretical Minimum, and doesn't get into calculations as much. (Although I looked up some equations in conjunction with reading this book, I don't think they really fit in this mini-review).\nThe history of thermodynamics is very interesting, and Paul Sen tells it well. I knew of figures like Carnot, Thomson / Lord Kelvin, and Joule but definitely learned some new things about their lives and research from reading this book; Helmholtz, Noether, and Landauer I didn't know much at all about before reading.\nCarnot was a French engineer active in the first part of the 19th century. His contribution to the science of thermodynamics was that getting useful energy out of heat requires a temperature difference:\nThroughout the rest of the 19th century, research in this new field continued. A landmark development was Joule's experiments on the mechanical equivalent of heat, demonstrating that it could be equated to other forms of energy. A breakthrough came when Clausius achieved a synthesis between Carnot's work and Joule's:\nAnother important synthesis in the field of thermodynamics involved two scales—the macro and the micro:\nThe micro-scale view leads in to statistical thermodynamics (analyzing the number of possible states; \"time's arrow\" is entangled with movement towards more probable arrangements). In this section of the book, I also appreciated the biographical details Sen shared about James Maxwell's life, such as the way his wife was a keen partner in his experiments.\nI liked this quote about refrigeration because it ties a few themes from the book—and a few principles from thermodynamics—together.\nAlso related to time (and my mention above of \"time's arrow\" in relation to statistical thermodynamics) and entropy, I thought this observation from Boltzmann was profound:\nIt is easy to forget in light of his more famous achievements, but Einstein did a lot of research in thermodynamics.\nThis mention of symmetry (and how it relates to conservation laws) was easier to follow/understand because I had already read The Theoretical Minimum:\nEinstein's Fridge had some good discussion on Claude Shannon and applying thermodynamics to information. It also covers the Landauer limit, where physics constrains the handling of information (processing information necessarily dissipates heat, specifically when something needs to be erased):\nThe book culminates by getting in to black holes, where many topics (entropy, information, etc.) come together. Synthesizing research by Bekenstein and Hawking, the surface area of a black hole's event horizon is a measure of its entropy.\nBonus content for this section: a blog post about the Carnot cycle and the patent for the namesake fridge by Einstein (and Szilard). Someday I think it would be fun to try to build a working model.\nCræft: An Inquiry into the Origins and True Meaning of Traditional Crafts by Alexander Langlands was one of the most enjoyable books I read last year and probably the one I'd soonest turn into a full post on its own if time permitted. The author has done a bunch of experimental archaeology of traditional British Isles trades and handicrafts—both as a hobby and professionally, including for a series of BBC documentaries.\nThe crafts that Alexander Langlands covers in Cræft range from beekeeping (including making skep hives from scratch) to haymaking to thatching to lime burning, and many more. It is not primarily a how-to book—although it does contain pretty decent (they'd benefit from sketches in a few places) instructions for many tasks—but rather conveys his thoughts about the meaning behind making. Near the beginning of the book he shares an anecdote about starting to cut his grass with a scythe:\nAround the same time (although I think I'd gotten the idea before reading this book) I got a sickle for keeping the thin strip of grass/weeds along my driveway trimmed, so I could relate to this. When I posted about it on Facebook, someone suggested tongue-in-cheek that I get a hammer to go with my sickle; I replied,\n(I'd also like a mattock after reading this book).\nThese thoughts were definitely inspired by reading Cræft. A podcast episode I listened to at some point in the past year also got me thinking along these lines: we use our tools to shape our world, but at the same time the tools we choose to use shape us. And I think this recent post I wrote is also relevant here.\nEarly in the book, Alexander Langlands spends some time discussing Aelfred the Great, who was a very accomplished king. Not only was he a defender of the realm and a promoter of education, but he personally translated some works into the English of his day:\nSomething that came up as a theme over and over was that managing the landscape for the supply of your raw materials is a crucial part of traditional trades/crafts. There is a lot of work upstream of actually starting at making something. Whether for thatching or for making wattle hurdles or for numerous other crafts, you need a supply of stalks or vines or branches with the right characteristics. You need them plentiful, and you need them nearby. Achieving this often draws on techniques like coppicing (or pollarding); in fact, he explicitly says that, \"the craft of hurdle making technically begins with the planting out and year-on-year management of coppice woodlands\". Here is a big-picture view Langlands gives of this interplay:\nHe has strong opinions on landscapes, and a section or two in Cræft covers how they can be divided up with the construction and maintenance of drystone walls and hedges:\nI can certainly appreciate his dislike for the aesthetics of the new way (barbed wire) of stockproofing and demarcating, but from other things I've read, I feel the need to point out that being able to do so with less effort does add value (similar points probably apply to many traditional trades/crafts)—less investment to delineate property rights and it frees up labour for the non-agricultural economy.\nHis extensive personal experience really shows in his discussion of thatching. In this example from the Hebrides, the sequence of different materials used in different layers is revealing of changing economic conditions:\nThe discussion of thatching made me think of a point from Harvesting the Biosphere about how modern varieties of wheat have undergone breeding to make them shorter (to maximize the edible portion of the crop); this leaves less residual straw, which isn't a problem now, but in the past the straw was far from a waste product and found numerous uses.\nThe author is delightfully eccentric. It comes across in many places in the book, such as his desire to make a cover to keep his firewood dry in the old-fashioned way:\nThe subject/title of one chapter was \"Fire and Earth\" (major Dwarf Fortress vibes, there):\nOne act of experimental archaeology they do in this chapter is lime burning in an old kiln: 20 tonnes of coal + 10 tonnes of limestone to produce 5 tonnes of quicklime (used for mortar, plaster, etc).\nThe final \"craft\" that I'll discuss in this mini-review—the book has plenty more and I hope I've whetted your appetite—is ship-building. I found it interesting how he related it to basket-making (especially for clinker construction as opposed to carvel-style) since I had a chance to see craftsmen building replica Viking boats at a museum in Denmark (more experimental archaeology):\nThe single movie I'll cover in this post is the Indian blockbuster RRR. As much as the film itself, I find the meta-story about the shifting global entertainment market notable. Hollywood has seemed for some time to be running out of creativity, just rehashing the same franchises—what's good isn't new and what's new isn't good (although as I'm writing this I just watched Oppenheimer, which is a welcome departure from these trends and that I may include in next year's mini-reviews). So I'm happy to see them get some competition. Parts of East Asia (especially Korea) are developing into entertainment powerhouses that are starting to compete with US shows and movies, but an advantage that India has is that there's a huge domestic pool of people who speak English. Balaji Srinivasan has pointed out that \"Indians will soon become the plurality of English speakers on the internet\"; this could be an earthquake on the media landscape (and none too soon). Of course, RRR was a very multi-lingual film (some lines are in English but the main dialogue was actually recorded and released in multiple Indian languages), but it demonstrated an ability to appeal to global audiences and to use the talents of an international pool of actors and actresses.\nAs for the movie itself, RRR was a typical Indian action movie*, albeit a notably successful one (grossing $150 million worldwide). It has action, patriotism, and bromance, all dialed up to 11 (see this famous scene for a taste). There's nothing subtle about the plot*, and the CGI is obvious enough to be distracting in some places. It's lots of fun as long as you don't take it too seriously. What is worth taking seriously, in my opinion, is the way that it shows that Bollywood and Tollywood can increasingly give Hollywood a run for its money.\nOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is a novel by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn about life in a Soviet prison camp. It is a short novel, but it is set in the span of a single day so it doesn't feel rushed in spite of that (I calculated that each page should average something like 6 minutes of real time). It is an ordinary day, neither the best nor worst that the main character would experience in the camp; the novel was intended to show ordinary citizens what these camps were like.\nThe main character, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, is a prisoner in his own country because he was briefly a prisoner outside of it. Stalin's paranoia was such that returned or escaped POWs during the Second World War were assumed to have been flipped by the enemy so rather than being given medals they were sent to the camps.\nThis book was allowed to be published in the USSR. This is because under Khrushchev, there was an effort to blame all of the oppression of the 1930s and 40s on Stalin's personality cult, instead of admitting they were an intrinsic feature of the Communist system. The Khrushchev years saw their own oppression (both the start of the construction of the Berlin Wall and the repression of the Hungarian uprising occurred during this period) but there was a brief thaw where folks like Solzhenitsyn were able to speak out.\nThe literary format is very effective. Focusing on a single day—and not a day with some grand happenings, just a mundane winter work day—gives space for plenty of description and really gets inside the perspective of the prisoners. There are the physical deprivations: hunger from scant rations, cold from working outside in a Siberian winter (in fact, the work helped keep them warm, it was standing still in ranks in the cold while the guards took count when the cold really bit). Even more than that, Solzhenitsyn makes readers feel how prisoners' horizons narrowed down to the most petty and immediate concerns. Rather than solidarity, they felt locked in competition with each other. Even little wins such as gathering small sticks to add to the meager coal used to heat their barracks didn't have much left over after the guards took their cut; if anyone ever got a care package from family, not only were there bribes to be paid to guards, but prisoners higher in the pecking order would be owed a share. They were left with so little margin or reserve that two weeks in solitary confinement on reduced rations was expected to be enough of a blow to a man's health to be likely to kill him. Far more than looking forward to getting released at the end of one's sentence, scoring an extra bread roll or a bit of tobacco somehow became one's over-riding objective.\nIt is a very memorable and compelling novel in the way that it conveys how the prisoners' goals narrow down to only their next bowl of soup. There are favours and bribes to be traded for every little thing (to the guards, but also among prisoners) and a constant vying with the guards for how little work they could get away with doing:\nHonestly, it doesn't sound like it was much better for the guards than it was for the prisoners, as the seriousness with which they counted prisoners going out on work details shows:\nI thought the matter of firewood was a neat example of even communists understanding economic incentives when they have to:\nThe way they kept control was by keeping the prisoners at one another's throats via collective punishment and insufficient resources (e.g. by organizing prisoners into work gangs to facilitate collective punishment/reward/pressure such as extra or less rations for the group):\nHowever, there was a paradoxical sense in which there was more freedom in the camps than anywhere else in the USSR:\nShukhov was at first in a camp in Komi (a region West of the Urals), rather than Siberia; but then he got moved to a \"special\" camp. His fellow prisoners included men from Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine—probably part of the reason mistrust for Russia endures in those countries.\nOverall, I really recommend this novel—and it doesn't take long to read anyway. It is quite evocative. I also think understanding some of what the Russian people went through in the 20th century sheds a bit of light on their mindset today.\nWhile reading One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, I also got thinking of another quote from the author (who was writing it from his own experience in the prison camp system):\nI believe that non-violent resistance is more morally admirable, but it's hard to decry Solzhenitsyn for his vehemence here coming out of his own experience of the Gulag camps. And, in point of fact, his actual actions were to endure the camps, write and speak against them (and also against censorship) in his own country as long as he was able, then finally to raise awareness of this oppression once he was in exile in the West.\nPermalink",

    "description": "\"What we call Man's power is, in reality, a power possessed by some men which they may, or may not, allow other men to profit by. ... From this point of view, what we call Man's power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument.\"",
    "content": "Applying some thoughts from an old book (or three) to some contemporary issues around technology.\nThis is not going to be a typical review post. Instead, I'll mainly share some quotes that stood out from a recent re-read of The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis and briefly explain their enduring relevance.\nIt was written 80 years ago (during the Second World War, and there's a few excerpts where keeping that in mind provides relevant context), but I think it still has useful things to contribute to contemporary debates around emerging technologies, like AI and biotech (I've got a partial draft of a post on the latter, so stay tuned).  Major themes of The Abolition of Man include reductionism, education, rightly-formed sentiments, and technologies of social control. It begins with Lewis' thoughts on some negative trends in education in his day, while the third and final chapter is where it most gets into the musings on science and technology that I'm most interested in drawing attention to with this post.\nWith that brief introduction, let's dive into the quotes.\nThis relates to the theme that rightly-formed sentiments should be an objective of education.\nThe first chapter of The Abolition of Man is framed as a response or rebuttal to an English textbook at the time that Lewis felt exemplified many of the flaws of contemporary education. A notion that he spends significant time arguing against is that emotions are purely subjective.\nThis continues the theme of rightly-ordered affections; it reminds me of a prayer from the Book of Common Prayer that begins, \"Almighty God, who alone can bring order to the unruly wills and passions of sinful humanity: give your people grace so to love what you command and to desire what you promise...\"\nIn the preceding excerpt, Lewis introduces what he calls the Tao: objective/universal morality, or a shared sense of the Good between diverse cultures around the world and throughout history.\nWhat makes our feelings reasonable or unreasonable.\nThis is probably one of the most widely known quotes from The Abolition of Man. Some of the ones later on relate more directly to the themes I wanted to discuss in this post, but the paragraph here is justly famous so I'll at least spend a bit of time on it. The 'Green Book' is the pseudonym for the textbook Lewis is criticizing and Gaius and Titius are pseudonyms for the authors; I think by using pseudonyms he's trying to emphasize that he is arguing with certain ideas, not trying to \"own\" or \"destroy\" (as in so much contemporary discourse) the people holding them. The ideas he's arguing with comprise a pedagogy that 'debunks' rightly-ordered sentiments instead of inculcating them. It is definitely one of the places where remembering it was written during WWII adds context and emotional weight (especially to the part that I've bolded): in times of necessity, we find that character traits like virtue, enterprise, and honour are highly valuable; education should promote these rather than undermining them.\nThis passage reminds me of Nassim Taleb's description of people who are \"intellectuals yet idiots\" and don't even lift.\nTurning skepticism back on the would-be debunkers.\nThis is a good description of our need for higher-level principles or axioms to decide between competing desires and instincts.\nThe start of Chapter 3 is central to what I wanted to focus on in this post, so I've included a picture showing the first two pages. I've also excerpted some specific sections in the text that continues below the image.\nHence the title of this post. This is a profound point about science and technology. Unlocking new abilities as our understanding of the world around us grows can be used for the benefit of humanity in general, and to some extent has been: since The Abolition of Man was published certain diseases such as smallpox have been eradicated, famines are far less frequent, and natural disasters are typically less deadly (due to improvements in early warning, search and rescue, medical care, etc.). On the other hand, only a couple of years after this book was published, the debut of the atomic bomb demonstrated this point (i.e. that applied science could give some people power over others) more comprehensively than Lewis probably imagined when he was writing it. His comment about long-term exercises of power is very relevant to how biotech could affect generations not yet born, although at the time (WWII era, recall) it was probably something more like eugenics that he had in mind.\nThe scientific and technological advances Lewis is most worried about are the ones that empower people—a select few—to manipulate human nature, both biologically and psychologically. Our knowledge of our own biology has advanced leaps and bounds since this book was written, so eugenics is no longer the state of the art. A 'perfect applied psychology' seems much further off (consider the replication crisis, for instance) but maybe that won't matter. I can imagine some AI-driven A/B testing of propaganda that ends up being very effective while remaining a black box.\nI like the wry descriptions in this summary of the history of the plans of 'educationalists' (and this excerpt in general fits well with some quotes from other authors I've included below). However, when it comes to fearing an 'omnicompetent state' I have some serious theoretical doubts. There's a case to be made that coherence doesn't scale with complexity, so large and powerful governments often aren't as successful at single-mindedly pursuing a goal. This is not to deny that very real and intense persecution can occur, but there's often an element of wanton stupidity to it (an example that comes to mind is the way Chairman Mao forced peasants all across China to produce steel in backyard furnaces: oppressive? yes; successful? not so much); in contrast, democracies muddle along inefficiently, but seem to yield more achievements on net.\nThis is where the title of the book comes from. Debunking or explaining away all values leaves only arbitrary/capricious Whim (the Latin phrase ≈ my wish is my command). Making even our own consciousness quantified and disenchanted will unlock power but at the same time strip away true agency from those at the top.\nThis quote and the following one extrapolate the endpoint of a reductionistic worldview.\nThe preceding is a key passage for Lewis' theme in the third chapter of The Abolition of Man, in my opinion. Do we proceed with the conquest of our own human nature?\nTo retain agency, we have to see ourselves as somewhat distinct from the rest of Nature. The Classical category for mankind was a \"rational animal\"—above the beasts and below the angels.\nWe need a reference point outside ourselves. Choose your axioms carefully.\nAnother spot where it is poignant to recall that this was published while WWII was still raging.\nThis is an eloquent (when reading a great writer like C.S. Lewis, you appreciate not only what they say, but how they say it) defense of the importance of axioms/first principles. Be careful with reductionist explanations and deconstruction. You wouldn't want to deconstruct something load-bearing, eh?\nIn this post, I thought I'd also include some notes and quotes from The Law by Bastiat, because they have an overlapping theme with the first part of this post in preserving agency for ordinary individuals.\nBastiat was not an American, but sometimes an outsider's perspective can provide unique insights. He spends some time in his book (which was written in 1850, before the US Civil War) contrasting property and plunder. Slavery was firmly in the plunder (i.e. illegitimate gains) category for him.\nThe Law is big on letting collective activity be uncoerced:\nHe relates the notion in the previous quote to a defense of negative rights:\nThe next several quotes remind me of what Lewis wrote about the \"Conditioners\". These are intellectuals and politicians who feel it is their rightful place to mold everyone else:\nHe doesn't mean it as a compliment that the political theorists he's referring to are fine with ignoring other people's agency.\nI like the sarcasm in this one.\n«Liberté, égalité, fraternité»\nBoom!\nThe Law might be a bit repetitive on this point, but it is a point that bears repeating. The people at large are not just there as raw material for the schemes and dreams of leaders, political theorists, intellectuals, or organizers.\nThis one is very reminiscent of a James Madison quote: \"If Men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\"\nLike I said near the start of this section, let collective activity be uncoerced.\nFinally, a quote from G.K. Chesterton on democracy ties some of these themes together nicely:\nDon't cede everything to experts, or, returning to the technological topics mentioned in my introduction, to AIs/algorithms.\nPermalink",

    "description": "\"'All keep the mines open; it is a work to be shared. But each digs for himself the thing he wants for his work. What else would he do?''It is not so with us.''Then you must make very bent work.'\" ~ Out of the Silent Planet, p.105",
    "content": "This year, I have a personal goal to read through 5 books that are all 500+ pages. The first of these was a re-read of The Lord of The Rings (and at the time of writing, I'm more than halfway through the second, an abridgment of Journey to the West titled The Monkey and The Monk). The post below was partially inspired by that, but draws on numerous other sources as well.\nThe title of this post comes from a conversation in Out of the Silent Planet, by C.S. Lewis. Let me set the context a bit then I'll share the conversation with the key part bolded. In Out of the Silent Planet, a professor in England named Ransom gets kidnapped and taken to Mars. There he meets three sentient species: Hrossa, Sorns, and Pfifltrigg. The latter look sort of like frogs and act like classical dwarves (with occupations as miners and craftsmen). One is carving a statue of a human using Ransom as a model and they get into a conversation about language (Ransom's academic specialty) that shifts to discussing politics and work.\nThe denizens of Lewis' Mars exist in a state of nigh-prelapsarian innocence. They aren't immune from accidents and tragedy, but because Earth (the titular Silent Planet) is under a celestial quarantine, deliberate oppression and exploitation are unknown among them. So their languages don't have much vocabulary around wrong-doing, and the best way they have of describing something that has gone awry or isn't as it should be is to call it \"bent\".\n(A few further explanations: Malacandra is the in-story name for Mars. Sun's blood and stars' milk are their names for two different minerals (perhaps gold and silver). A handramit is a deep canyon (and has been referenced on this blog before).)\nNote as well that Out of the Silent Planet was written before the Green Revolution, so it was actually pretty reasonable for an educated man like Ransom to be uncertain about the answer to the question at the end of this excerpt.\nFrom this conversation, I see two crucial pre-requisites for avoiding \"bent work\".  The first is an intimate knowledge of the raw materials you are working with, ideally through first-hand experience with obtaining it. The second is avoiding oppressing or exploiting others in how you obtain your inputs. There is also an implication that you should love your vocation.\nThis theme of love is front and centre in the following passage from The Lord of The Rings. It takes place just after the battle of Helm's Deep. During the fighting, Gimli the dwarf got separated from his companions and, together with some men of Rohan, fought a rear-guard action into the caverns there. When he is reunited with Legolas the elf, what is on top of his mind is not the battle, but the beauty of these caves:\nI don't think it is too much of a stretch to say that Gimli is infatuated here. He claims that his reaction to such splendor would be the reaction of any dwarf, so that none would want to work in such a way that would mar the natural endowment of the caverns.\nThere is a stark contrast to this love and respect for what is pre-existing later in the same chapter when the companions arrive at Orthanc. It features mighty works of men of Westernesse that Saruman marred:\nLet's move from fictional examples to a discussion of how stuff gets made in the real contemporary world. Because of the places my job takes me (industrial sites all around Canada and the US and sometimes beyond, looking at wastewater treatment for them) as well as some hobbies I have, I feel comfortable saying that I spend a lot more time thinking about modes of production than the average person does. There are a couple of different modes of production that we can apply the insights from the previous section to, ranging from artisanal to industrial (of course there are many types of work in the modern economy that don't produce any kind of physical artifact, but I'll be focusing on work that has a tangible product).\nArtisanal production is easy to idealize. Now that it usually occurs in a hobby context or as the freely-chosen vocation of someone following their passions, it is likely done with love. And the opportunity to get hands-on with many stages of the work (if not always all the way to the raw materials) allows one to gain intimate familiarity with the materials being used.\nFor an example of the artisanal mode, the stool in the photo above is something I made as a recent DIY project. I think it makes a good illustration of tacit knowledge; because I was doing everything myself, I didn't need to draw out detailed plans in advance, just a rough idea to go on, which I filled in as I went based on experience with previous projects. The end result was that a single board (which can be thought of as 2 dimensional since the thickness is small compared to the length and width) became this complex and useful 3-dimensional object. Reflecting afterwards on all the steps that I'd done, it involved cutting the board into 8 pieces, then drilling 48 holes (for 24 dowel pegs) and chiselling out 2 dadoes to connect them in the right configuration (this is just for the main structure; I'm not listing the steps for making the decorative cut-outs, bevelling the edges, etc.). Doing all this oneself really gives a feel for how the material behaves.\nWhen it comes to the modern industrial mode of production, it's no secret that Tolkien—and other English literary greats—viewed it with suspicion. Personally, I don't see it as intrinsically \"bent\", but it perhaps needs more care to avoid becoming so. Obviously I have some bias here due to my livelihood being tied up in it, but I also believe that the answer to Kanakaberaka's final question in the opening excerpt now being a firm yes is a strong argument in its favour.\nThe city of Sarnia, Ontario has probably the highest concentration of heavy industry of any place I've been so far. It makes a good illustration of how the modern industrial mode of production works. Around the main refineries and chemical plants, there is an entire constellation of industrial supply companies, welding shops, rental places for cranes and heavy equipment, work-wear stores, and labour union halls. Even something like hotels that may seem unrelated at first is an essential part of this ecosystem, so out-of-town contractors have a place to stay. No planner could lay out in advance everything that would need to be included in this constellation, or how many of each, but each business can see its own small piece of the puzzle and consider advantageous places to locate. These considerations multiplied across the whole sector yield what you see in a place like Sarnia as an emergent effect. The famous essay \"I, Pencil\" describes this effect:\nI don't think it's literally true that no one knows how to make a pencil—the Primitive Technology guy on YouTube can make at least some of the components from scratch—but rather no one has all the knowledge that goes into being able to make over a billion pencils per year, sell them from less than a quarter each, and make a profit. The essay goes on to discuss the \"innumerable antecedents\" that go into even superficially-simple manufacturing. No one grasps the entire picture, perhaps not even within a firm.\nSo in this context, how does someone do their work in the way described in the previous section: intimate knowledge of your materials, first-hand experience, avoiding oppression and exploitation, and doing it with love? One thing that comes to mind is to have some awareness and appreciation for the people and steps involved 'upstream' and 'downstream' of your own work. Where possible, getting some hands-on experience with some of these steps is even better. Rotating new hires through different front-line production roles (where feasible) is a good idea in my opinion. In my own professional life, I appreciate that my job includes some occasional fieldwork. Usually I'm using data from others, but several times a year I collect some samples and do some laboratory tests on them. The data from these sorts of tests is an important input to my work, so having a tangible sense of where it comes from and how it is obtained is valuable. Going out and getting dirty—my clothes have been covered in sludge more than once—also promotes camaraderie and lowers barriers with the wastewater plant operators who do the same sort of thing day-to-day. Aside from the fieldwork that is still a periodic part of my job, the hands-on aspects of collecting and analyzing samples was a beneficial part of my graduate education.\nWe can also look at this whole issue on a societal level. There's something that doesn't sit right with me when people who enjoy all the benefits of modern technology don't want the essential work for provisioning it to take place anywhere near them, or when industries that we all rely on are looked down on (this is not the same as continually pushing those industries to get cleaner or improve in other ways). Conflict minerals and forced labour in overseas supply chains seem pretty \"bent\" to me, especially when domestic production that could fill some of the same demand is throttled.\nMaybe rather than industrialization per se, the problem with how Saruman is developping Isengard (in the second excerpt from The Lord of The Rings included above) is High Modernism, as defined in this widely-cited book review, running roughshod over everything:\nThis was a powerful force at the time the books cited in the first section of this post were written. Out of the Silent Planet was published in 1938 and The Lord of The Rings was published in 1955. For comparison, the projects by Le Corbusier discussed in the linked book review took place in the early 1930s (Moscow) and early 1950s (Chandigarh).\nIn contrast, the modern industrial mode of production with Sarnia as a concentrated example is less top-down, to the extent it can be thought of as an ecosystem. No one has the end-to-end view like you get with artisanal production, but everyone does freely pursue his or her own specialization.\nIn this final section, I just wanted to share some poetry, music, etc. on this theme of working in a way that isn't bent.\nOne poem that comes to mind is Kipling's \"Hymn to Breaking Strain\" on the importance of knowing the capabilities and capacities of the materials you work with:\nI also really like this poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins, which conveys a sentiment of love for the diverse tools of various trades (among other things):\nThis original song promotes a \"dwarven\" mindset to work, including the brilliant line, \"Here sweat must flow before the ale, and apron donned before the mail\". On a related note, check out the song \"Heigh Ho\" from the same channel.\nFinally, I'll share a link to a previous blog post I wrote on the subject of work, which also draws on some of Tolkien's writings.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Some thoughts on Matthew 16:14\nMatthew 16:13-16 is a famous passage in the New Testament. The beginning and end are justly the best-known parts, but in this post I wanted to share something that jumped out at me this year from the verse in the middle:\nI had a physics teacher in high school who would sometimes mark homework problems \"WBC\", meaning \"wrong but consistent\" (or perhaps it was InBC = \"incorrect but consistent\"⁠—it's been almost two decades so the details could be fuzzy) when a student had made a mistake in arithmetic or something early on, but followed a reasoning and calculation process that would have gotten to the right answer if it hadn't been for that one error. That's what I think of Matthew 16:14. Peter gives the vital, true response in verse 16; the people in verse 14, although they're missing some crucial pieces of the puzzle, still are following insightful lines of reasoning though.\nElijah and John the Baptist are fairly obvious answers. Elijah was a powerful miracle worker, just as Jesus was. Also, the fact that he was taken up into heaven by a chariot of fire instead of dying meant that his return was expected (for example, a glass of wine is often left out for him at Passover meals). John the Baptist was prominent in recent memory and Jesus preached a very similar message (Mark 1:4-8,14-15). But out of all the other prophets, why does Jeremiah get singled out by name here?\nJeremiah was one of the major prophets in the Old Testament. Let's consider his life and message for clues. One of the things that stands out is that the book that bears his name has a lot of biographical details. Many of the prophetic books focus on the prophet's message, but the book of Jeremiah tells us a lot about his life experiences (Daniel and Jonah are similar in this regard).\nJeremiah had a very awkward message to deliver. Rather than being able to tell his countrymen that they could triumph in war over their enemies if they would trust God, instead he had to advise them to surrender to the Babylonians and submit to exile as discipline from the Lord. Using the imagery (and a prop!) of a yoke, Jeremiah's message of surrender is contrasted to the false hope held out by a false prophet. But Jeremiah did have hope to offer: exile was discipline, not destruction (a theme that I think is echoed by other prophets), and it would be of finite duration. This comes up over and over. He sent a letter to the exiles instructing them to settle down and have families, expecting to be there for a couple of generations, but that there would be a future return. While Jerusalem was under siege, he bought a piece of property to testify that \"houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land\". And he prophesied that Babylon would fall and a time would come to flee.\nStill, his counselling surrender made him viewed as a traitor, and he suffered a lot of persecution for it. He was arrested and beaten by a priest. Religious leaders called for his death. One king (Jehoiakim) burned a scroll of Jeremiah's prophesies when it was read to him; another king (Zedekiah) imprisoned Jeremiah but still wanted to hear what he had to say (reminding me of Herod and John the Baptist or Felix and Paul). The culmination of this persecution saw Jeremiah lowered into an underground cistern and left to die (although he ended up getting rescued and raised back out).\nHere are some of the specific details of his life and message that I believe may be relevant to his mention in Matthew 16:14:\nBefore trying to tie it all together in the final section, the next section is a digression into the history of Mesopotamia in the time of Jeremiah.\nLast year, on one of my trips to Kansas, I passed the time driving across the wide-open landscape by listening to a very long podcast series about the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian/Achaemenid empires (technically neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian). This was the \"Kings of Kings\" series by Dan Carlin (parts 1,2,3). Dan Carlin is a masterful storyteller, and I found learning more about the secular history of the Ancient Near East and Mesopotamia during this era quite helpful for understanding more context about the Biblical prophets. These Hardcore History episodes really drove home how tumultuous the century and a half from 650 BC - 500 BC (this spans the Jewish Babylonian captivity (597 - 538 BC) plus about a generation on either side) was in that region. Aside from Isaiah (c. 740 - 680 BC), the rest of the 4 major prophets were active in this timeframe: 626 - 587 BC for Jeremiah, 593 - 571 BC for Ezekiel, and during the 500s for Daniel. It was a period that saw three major empires succeed one another in rapid fashion. In addition to where these events intersect the prophetic books of the Bible, there are some other very interesting episodes in the rise and fall of these empires. I particularly liked how Dan Carlin told about the rise of the Persian king Darius, and how if you read between the lines of history, there likely was a conspiracy and cover-up that put him on the throne. As the Persian empire expanded, it started clashing with the Greeks. If your history education was more Western-focused (as mine was), you'll be familiar with the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC) featuring the Spartans' famous last stand, and then, several generations later, the conquests of Alexander the Great (356 - 323 BC), which included the Persian Empire. The detailed accounts of the Greco-Persian wars and the conquests of Alexander the Great also make these podcast episodes worth listening to.\nBetween these episodes of Hardcore History linked in the previous paragraph and the useful reference site geacron.com, here are some notable people and events from the time of Jeremiah and some of the other prophets that are good context to keep in mind:\nSection II listed some of the parallels between Jeremiah and Jesus. One of the things that stands out with Jeremiah being mentioned in the same sentence as John the Baptist and Elijah is that each of them suffered persecution. Elijah had to live in hiding/exile because of King Ahab and Jezebel. John the Baptist was imprisoned and beheaded by one of the Kings Herod. And as we've seen above, the religious and political authorities kept trying to silence Jeremiah. Indeed, later in the same chapter of Matthew, Jesus explains that suffering is an unavoidable part of his mission on earth.\nAnother commonality is that these three answers hint towards life after death (contra the sect of the Sadducees). John the Baptist had been beheaded only a couple of chapters earlier, so anyone that thought Jesus was he would have to believe that he had miraculously survived or been raised to life. Elijah didn't die but was taken up. For Jeremiah, there's the incident with the cistern, where he was basically buried for a period of time. (And even for \"one of the prophets\" Jesus mentions the sign of Jonah—another image of burial, this time beneath the waves—earlier in Matthew 16).\nTo finish this post, one of my favourite accounts on YouTube, Clamavi de Profundis, recently released a musical setting of Lamentations 1:1-5, where Jeremiah is mourning over Jerusalem (another parallel with Jesus).\nHappy Easter!\nPermalink",

    "description": "Our provincial net debt in New Brunswick is now smaller than the size of the annual budget.",
    "content": "The topic of healthcare is too broad to do it justice in a single post (or in two either, to be fair, but I'll make an attempt), so I'm continuing to examine it in this year's budget write-up.\nLast year, I looked at some big picture statistics that showed New Brunswick isn't really under-investing in healthcare compared to other provinces or peer countries. The strain on the system has more to do with the ever-rising demands imposed by an aging population than with political neglect. Indeed, healthcare systems in more than one peer country (e.g. UK and Germany, which also have aging populations) are bursting at the seams in the same way as here in Canada. In this year's post, I want to get into more of the concrete details of the operations of the regional health authorities.\nAs per usual, I'll try to keep most of the amounts in millions (M) of dollars (CAD) because I think it's easier to compare than mixing million and billions. And while I'll mostly refer to it as the 2023 budget, it is technically for the 2023-2024 fiscal year. Also per usual, I'll try to primarily focus on the facts and figures rather than opinion/commentary.\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nThe net debt will now be less than the annual budget, and only around 25% of provincial GDP (assuming the economy stays relatively stable). It is also less than it was when I started writing these posts in 2015 (i.e. $12600M).\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nThere was a 10.7% increase in the funding for the department of health and an 9.4% increase in the funding for the department of education and early childhood development over what was budgeted last year. The department of social development had a 11.3% increase. There was a large increase in percentage terms (although a much smaller absolute increase compared to the larger departments) to Natural Resources and Energy Development, which seems to mainly be about a new Energy Efficiency fund. There were also increases to the Justice/Public Safety department for more funding for the RCMP and corrections officers. A notable decrease (over 20%) was to the department of Environment and Local Government, which I assume is anticipated savings (or reconfigured spending anyway) from recent restructuring of local government in NB (I had a short discussion of how things used to be here).\nHere are a few graphs related to expenditures: an overall pie chart of spending by department, and breakdowns within 2 of the 3 largest departments (78% of the spending within Education and Early Childhood Development goes to school districts, so it would have been a boring pie chart):\nBecause inflation has been quite high recently, I wanted to see how the increases to the budget compared to that. Looking back pre-Covid to the 2019 budget, it had $9823M in Expenditures.  Cumulative inflation from 2019 to 2023 has been 14.87%, so $11284M would be needed just to keep up. Looking at the actual 2023 budget, it has increased by 7.7% over and above inflation since 2019.\nOn the revenue side of the 2023 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nHere is a graph of revenue by source budgeted for the fiscal year ahead:\nThe increase anticipated in income (personal and corporate) tax and sales tax revenue comes from a growing economy and expanding tax base rather than increases in rates. In fact, the 2023 budget is expecting less revenue in these categories than was actually received last year—but significantly more than was in last year's budget. There was a very large surplus from the fiscal year just ending, in large part because the tax revenue came in much higher than expected. There is some debate over how much of that increase is permanent versus a one-time windfall, so the new 2023 budget projects revenue in these categories somewhere between what was expected and what was actually received in the 2022 fiscal year. With a possible recession on the horizon, this seems like a pragmatic approach to me, but not everyone sees it that way.\nProperty tax revenues are anticipated to decline, which does appear to be related to rate changes, specifically rate reductions affecting residential rental properties.\nEqualization payments are growing. These are calculated on a per capita basis, so a growing population is driving this. Under the category of \"Other Transfers from the Federal Government\", the \"Conditional Health Transfer\" increased from $81M to $168M as well.\nI took a look at the Government of New Brunswick's annual report on hospital services as well as the annual report for Horizon Health, the English-language Regional Health Authority (see here and here for archives of these documents from previous years). Both of these documents were published last year and cover the 2020-2021 or 2021-2022 fiscal year; the ones for last year haven't been released yet, and because the budget is a forward-looking document, these reports would actually correspond to the budget from 2 or 3 years ago. With that caveat that the information is slightly out of date, here are some interesting facts and figures I found:\nNote that all of these statistics are from a time period that was impacted by the pandemic.\nYou often hear about rapidly-expanding administrations as a driver for costs in some sectors. For example, Yale University has more administrators than students and Stanford has more staff (counting faculty and administration, but with almost seven times more administration that faculty) than students. So it is good to see that in New Brunswick hospitals front-line roles outnumber administrative and support functions (not that these don't matter, but it's about where you keep the focus).\nI generally try to keep these budget review posts focused on the facts—and maybe some forecasts/predictions—rather than my opinions, but I feel this point is worth making an exception for. The government of NB has faced vocal pressure to loosen the purse strings instead of paying down the debt. I hope they continue to hold the line on this. Yes, the healthcare system and other provincial services are under a lot of strain. If it was a short-term crisis that would be one thing, but I believe this is the new normal and we have to figure out how to make things work—within our means!—in the situation we find ourselves in. The demographic realities aren't going away. Hopefully the economic situation improves somewhat as the disruption of the pandemic fades in the rearview mirror, but I don't know anyone serious who expects the combination of near-zero interest rates and sub-2% inflation to come back anytime soon. Put together, I believe we need to steward our resources for increased challenges ahead, or at least the potential for such. The good news is that a growing population and a falling debt give more room to manoeuvre, and we'll probably end up glad that we kept our powder dry for the back half of the 2020s. To be very blunt, I think it's at least possible that we're still in the calm before the storm (in terms of demographic-driven demand increases and labour crunches, the monetary environment, and the intrusion of outside events inter alia).\nMy post from a few years ago (mere weeks before the Covid-19 lockdowns began) focused on demographic pressure on NB's fiscal situation (i.e. the dependency ratio and related topics). I encourage you to go back and re-read the final section. In the years since, things have actually improved quite a bit on that front, with the population of the province growing again after years of stagnation. This probably was driven at least as much by external factors (e.g. increased remote work, desires of families to get out of crowded cities, and housing that's more affordable compared to the rest of the country—scant comfort though that may be to New Brunswickers trying to buy a home right now) as by political effort, but at least the provincial government (and local municipalities too) haven't gotten in the way of it yet. I appreciated what David Campbell had to say on the pains of growth being better than the pains of shrinking.\nFor a view of what our future as a province could have looked like if we'd stayed on the path we were on, of a stagnant population and growing debt, look at Newfoundland and Labrador. They are the most indebted province in Canada on a per-capita basis and are even resorting to foreign bond markets (not necessarily a bad thing in itself, just a sign that juggling the debt around is taking up more of their leaders' time and attention). In the years to come, I expect they'll see widespread service shortages/cuts (e.g. more frequent hospital closures), maybe a bail-out from the Feds [again], and struggle to balance the budget even so.\nFurther to the point about demographics, The End of the World is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan (which I reviewed here) has a lot to say on this topic. Including this prediction:\nHere is a recent video he did about Canada's situation in this regard. The protests in France over raising the retirement age to 64 demonstrate that the challenges posed by aging populations are not restricted to one country but span most of the developped world. And they can limit our options for dealing with some of the other challenges we face (e.g. trying to transition to new sources of energy, increasingly aggressive hostile superpowers).\nThe past month has brought some vivid illustrations of the precarious balancing act that is the current monetary policy environment. There were 3 or 4 weekends in a row (hopefully contained now) that saw banks in the US or Europe (including a Swiss bank!) in business on Friday and not on Monday. These happenings were related to the bond market, which is inextricably linked to government debts. See the graph of unrealized losses for US banks in this explanatory article on recent bank collapses. If I understand correctly, rising interest rates lower the market value of bonds. Monetary policy is caught between a rock and a hard place: they want to raise interest rates to control inflation, but raising it too much means that governments can't get as good of terms on their own debts, and also increases risks that other borrowers will default, which then ripples out into the rest of the economy as losses for lenders. Carrying less debt right now is probably wise.\nCanadian citizens (not just our governments) have a lot of debt: two trillion dollars in mortgage debt alone. That means a mere 0.25 percentage point change in interest rates can drive a $5 billion annual shift in debt service cash flows nationwide (not all immediately, as fixed rate mortgages are only affected upon renewal). Interest rates have changed by much more than that, so this really reduces the collective discretionary spending available to Canadian households.\nThe Federal budget has come out by the time you're reading this, but when I was drafting it, I read an article with a preview and this quote from the Finance Minister:\nThis is another piece of evidence that balancing trying to control inflation and not overwhelming people too badly with rising interest rates is a pretty delicate task right now.\nThe topics in the previous paragraphs are all intertwined. I wrote on Facebook recently about what I labelled as \"Canadian politics' Kobayashi Maru era:\"\nI wrote this before the budget came out. Overall healthcare funding in New Brunswick ended up increasing by around 10%; I assume the specific deal between the Federal government and the provinces discussed here is related to the $87M increase in the Conditional Health Transfer.\nHere is the graph referred to:\nFinally, here are some links with references and related topics:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I spent quite a bit of time in southwestern Kansas last year, on account of a couple of projects with my work. On one of these trips, I had a bit of extra time on the (long) drive from Wichita, so I stopped at a small-town museum built around a very large hand-dug well.\nThe Big Well Museum in Greensburg, Kansas claims to have the world's largest hand-dug well. It was built in the 1880s (finished in 1888) and has a depth of 109 ft and a diameter of 32 ft (for a volume of 87,700 cu. ft.). According to the museum, it took 30 men working for nine months (for no more than $2 per day) to build it. It's not entirely clear if that includes teams quarrying and transporting stone for the wall of the well, or if it only includes the team working on-site.\nThe museum also has a lot of general information about the town itself. It suffered a devastating tornado in 2007 and has tried to rebuild in a very energy-efficient and sustainable manner. It's also interesting to see the summary of what was in the town at the time the well was built and how it compares to the present. Back in the late 19th century, Greensburg had 2,000 people, 4 banks, 6 grocery stores, and numerous other small businesses. Now it only has a population of less than 750, with fewer thriving businesses. Agriculture takes less labour than it used to, and transportation has gotten better, so a lot of services don't need to be available in every town anymore.\nThe Big Well is dug into the Ogallala Aquifer, which is a major source of water (especially for agricultural irrigation) across a wide arc in the Great Plains of the United States. Because of the intensity with which its water is used, this aquifer is being depleted in many places. A couple of hours further West (where it is significantly more arid), an old farmer told me that new wells in that area are now drilled 600 - 800 ft deep; the aquifer is dropping by around 1 - 3 ft per year in that area.  Greensburg hasn't seen nearly as drastic a decline, but the museum still covers this issue.\nHere are a couple of photos from the museum:\nFor comparison to the Big Well in Kansas, I looked through a coffee table book I have about Stepwells in India: Vanishing Stepwells of India, by Victoria Lautmann. I wanted to see how well the Big Well's claim to be the largest hand-dug well in the world would hold up, since I knew there are some pretty large stepwells.\nStepwells are structures that provide access from the surface level down to where groundwater can be found. The tiered steps mean that there will be access even if the water level fluctuates seasonally (since most of the annual precipitation and aquifer recharge occurs during the Monsoon). If I understand correctly, the large volume of a stepwell probably provides a secondary function as a cistern to capture and store monsoon rains and could also help recharge the aquifer. Stepwells have various formats, ranging from inverted pyramids (probably the most iconic and recognizable), to linear channels, to spirals.\nThe following images show how stepwells can provide adaptable access at drastically different water levels:\n(See here for a view of seasonally changing water levels in a different context).\nUsing Vanishing Stepwells of India (which provides coordinates along with names and descriptions of the stepwells it covers) as a starting point, here is a list of some large and significant stepwells to compare to the Big Well in Kansas.\nThe first two in the list are probably among the largest and most famous stepwells in India. It can be seen that the Big Well in Kansas is larger based on depth, but if you consider the total excavated volume, these stepwells are far larger. In fact, the shaft at the western end of Rani ki Vav is only a little smaller than the Big Well.\nIt's no coincidence that the geographical distribution of stepwells is concentrated in Rajasthan and Gujarat. This is a water-stressed region, like the American High Plains, where innovation and investment has always been required to manage water resources.\nTo wrap this post up, here are some additional links to enjoy:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Contrasting and synthesizing the perspectives of Balaji Srinivasan and Peter Zeihan. Skim down to the section on \"Contrasting Geopolitical Outlooks\" if you want to get to the main part of this post more quickly.\nThe present moment certainly feels like we can't take anything for granted anymore. Recent events such as the on-going war in Ukraine and the continuing after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have put a lot of strain on the established geopolitical system. Maybe everything will return to normal after a bit more time to adjust. But what if it doesn't? In fact, even before the past few years, many observers were questioning how much longer the geopolitical status quo had in it (e.g. whether and when an alternative global reserve currency to the US dollar would emerge).\nI recently read a couple of books that touch on this question of \"What's Next?\". The Network State by Balaji Srinivasan is a meta-manifesto for communities rooted in the cloud to fill the middle ground between anarchy and tyranny. The End of the World is Just the Beginning by Peter Zeihan is a guide to the strategic geography of a deglobalized world. Both books were released last year (2022). They have very different views on how the relative strength of the USA and China will trend over the next decade or two, although both expect major changes from the status quo. From the outset of this meandering review of both books, I want to emphasize the value in reading the two of them. If you read a book with punditry and prognostications in isolation, it's easy to think the author has it all figured out and be too credulous about their conclusions; reading multiple authors with different views is a way to uncover their assumptions and dig into the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments. I have a lot of respect for the intelligence of both of these men, but they aren't prophets. So this post isn't about figuring out what will happen geopolitically in the 2020s, but rather to try to conceptualize the possibility space. And for that task, points of disagreement can be as illuminating as points of agreement.\nEach author brings a unique focus and, conversely, various blindspots of their own. Balaji Srinivasan places a lot of emphasis on how technology interacts with and enables political possibilities. He's also big on the importance of healthy institutions. Peter Zeihan's focus is more on the way geography (access to natural resources, ease of internal transportation, and defensible borders, to list some key factors) determines national outcomes. Along with this, he puts a lot of weight on how demographics—notably the age pyramid shape—inexorably influences economic trends (Hans Rosling also emphasized the reliability of demographic projections). Understanding their different analytical frameworks can shed light on some of the places their predictions differ. For example, Balaji's focus on technology means that he doesn't think a large population of working/fighting-age adults is as important a factor in the strength of a country anymore because he thinks automation will be able to take up a lot of slack (e.g. industrial robots and combat drones).\nAnother crucial piece of context for understanding their work and forecasts is where each author lives. Balaji Srinivasan was born and raised in the USA, but recently moved to Asia (Singapore, with considerable time also spent in India, from what I understand). This reflects his view that competant governance and national unity is important. Peter Zeihan lives in the Rocky Mountains near Denver: a defensible location adjacent to the most important agricultural region in the world. This reflects his view of the importance of reliable transportation (river or rail) of vital natural resources (food, energy, and materials). To be fair, I don't actually know why each author lives where he does, but they are both thorough and careful enough thinkers that I doubt it's entirely coincidence that their choices of residence reflect their outlooks.\n(Before I get further into these reviews, a quick note about names: I'll mainly refer to Balaji Srinivasan by his first name and Peter Zeihan by his last name. This isn't a sign of any difference in the level of respect or familiarity towards these authors but simply follows from how they most commonly refer to themselves. See for example, their website URLs or main social media accounts.)\nIn the following sections, I'll provide an overview of each book, get into the core of their disagreements, then cover less central material from the books and related articles for further reading.\nThe theme of this post is not actually the main theme of The Network State.  It is about, well, Network States. What are those? The front matter gives some useful summaries of various levels of detail, such as this sentence:\nThe geopolitical outlook conveyed in this book comes up largely in the context of why the time is right for this type of governance innovation. I'll get to that in a subsequent section; in this section I wanted to cover some of the other material from the book that is worth discussing.\nOne of the things that stands out about The Network State is its structure. Right at the beginning, it has a Quickstart section that provides executive summaries of various lengths: one sentence, a 7-point outline, and an essay. More books should do this. Each chapter also begins with a pretty clear overview of what it is going to cover, with more detail added as you read on. This gives the whole book a bit of a fractal feel: repetition at increasingly fine-grained scales. So a totally valid way to read it would be to check out the Quickstart section and then drill into the parts that interest you the most. I should also note that it is written as a native e-book, and makes a lot of use of the features that format enables (e.g. hyperlinking) instead of being like a traditional book that you're just happening to read on a screen; it is also freely available online in its entirety.\nBalaji Srinivasan is an extremely-online venture capitalist, and this really comes out in the book he's written. For one thing, he has an obvious hobby-horse about ethics in tech journalism, and instances of the New York Times being wrong are collected with the passion of a philatelist and shared in footnotes or bullet points. Furthermore, he really brings what I think of as a Silicon Valley mindset to the topics he discusses (this is not a bad thing in my view—this mindset has led to breakthroughs in solving problems in other domains, so it is at least worth trying in politics): being data-driven (e.g. setting up dashboards with key metrics), focusing on founders/start-ups instead of trying to solve new problems in existing institutions, rapidly iterating instead of getting bogged down in the planning/approvals phase (\"move fast and break things\"), and hunting for \"unicorns\" (venture capitalists can accept most of their investments failing because the few that win big have such enormous upside that it makes up for a lot of losses).\nThe Network State has the feel of a political manifesto but I'd describe it as more of a meta-manifesto. Balaji doesn't tell readers what kind of network state they should start (although he does offer a few example suggestions); rather, he lays out a roadmap for how people with various ideas for intentional affinity-based polities could attempt to put them into practice. He also covers the general case for why someone might want to do so, and some reasons why the time might be ripe; these themes build on grand theories of history and politics that he presents.\nThe roadmap Balaji presents contains some genuine innovations over the conventional how-to-start-your-own-country genre. First of all, instead of starting with some particular territory (whether a corner of unclaimed land due to border anomalies, a platform built in international waters, or a ZEDE), he recommends starting by building a community (around some moral or lifestyle differentiator) and acquiring land afterwards. A network becoming a nation, as he puts it. The other twist is the weight he places on seeking diplomatic recognition instead of merely de facto sovereignty. This is from hard-learned lessons from Bitcoin, that you need some legitimate interface with existing systems. The initial community is built in the cloud and should have a distinctive moral innovation (what he calls a One Commandment)—you're not likely to succeed with a \"Year Zero\", written-from-scratch society; it's better to \"fork\" existing society on one point of disagreement/innovation (you can add more reforms later, iteratively) where you can make a moral argument for a better way of doing things. Because the community starts in the cloud, it doesn't need all of its members to be in one place:\nTechnological developments have enabled this kind of geographically dispersed type of community:\nWhat makes network states an attractive innovation (at least to some people)? One answer is an increased ability to \"vote with your feet\" (inspired by Hirschman's concept of voice and exit):\nAdditionally, a new frontier has a lot of value for promoting/allowing innovation and serving as a relief valve for domestic political polarization:\nAnd the digital world is a logical place to root a new frontier:\nFinally, facilitating a huge expansion in the number of polities would ground political and social theories in more empirical data, which existing countries could learn lessons from about what works and what doesn't:\nSimilarly, Balaji discusses how cryptocurrencies have provided a surge in the amount of experimental data in macroeconomics. He clearly states his goal/wish that network states could make history and political science more experimental disciplines. And in The Network State he shares some theories of history and politics that he sees as decent starting points for developping testable models.\nThe following excerpts give a sense of the quantitative approach he'd like to bring to history:\nCensorship and misinformation are both seen as threats to having reliable historical data to work with. This focus on a data-driven approach is part of what I meant earlier about an obvious Silicon Valley perspective on the part of the author. He also takes the view that witnessing the way start-up companies morph their culture as they become bigger and more established provides some transferrable insights into social and bureaucratic dynamics in general:\nA willingness to experiment and then pragmatically shift course as needed is also mentioned as a strength that tech folks can bring to the challenges described in this book:\nI'll get into the geopolitical forecasts Balaji makes in another section below, but as a high-level summary, he expects increasing social fragmentation and political dysfunction/division in the United States; on the other side of the world in China he expects digital totalitarianism to grow in scope and effectiveness. The rest of the world will be torn between these models, while cryptocurrency and related technologies will make an anarchic \"none of the above\" more of a viable option in both domestic and international affairs, making it harder for any kind of moderate centre to hold. This anticipated political environment presents both a need and an opening for the type of alternative an idea like network states can offer.\nThe educational background that Balaji brings to his ideas and writings gives him a preference for theories/models of history and politics that make testable (ideally quantitative) predictions. For example, he refers to the cyclical models of Peter Turchin and Ray Dalio which predict that the coming decade is on schedule for conflict and a likely shift in global hegemony. He also offers a thesis that is kind of technologically deterministic, where the prevailing technologies a generation or two ago favoured centralization, while the ones at the forefront now favour decentralization; the outcome of this model is a future (in a political sense) that looks more like the US pre-New Deal. In domestic politics, he has a model where the political axis/spectrum swings around over time so that Left and Right have different positions on the object level from decade to decade, but represent stable coalitions. In fact,  he argues that tribal alignments are often more stable than the ideologies they tout at any given time (e.g. VA and MA voting differently, US and Russia in opposition whether over Communism or Irredentism).\nBalaji is heavily focused on technology, and his views on that inform some of the material in his book. One relevant tech trend is artificial intelligence. Not only could it help with automation (allowing productivity growth even with stagnant or declining working-age populations), it could also be a boon for authoritarian surveillance and/or facilitate the even more rapid production and dissemination of misinformation:\nI could see this turning into a significant arms race, and it's not clear to me whether the ability to monitor and analyze enormous amounts of data or the ability to generate digital \"chaff\" will advance more quickly.\nAnother relevant tech trend to The Network State is the concept of Augmented Reality (AR). Requiring the right credentials or digital passport to even \"see\" certain things overlaid on the real world would provide some value-add that membership in a Network State could offer.\nThese views on technology are a notable point of contrast with Peter Zeihan. As you'll see in the next section, Zeihan doesn't think any new technologies will fundamentally transform the old strategic necessities of a healthy population structure, access to vital natural resources, and defensible borders.\nI'll skip a lot of the specific roadmap to starting a Network State for the purposes of this review, but if you're interested in that or in exploring some of the ideas I did cover in this section in more detail, you can read the book or listen to this podcast interview with the author.\nFinally, I'll note in advance of the sections below that Balaji's predictions (for the US and China, etc.) are different from his values. His moral vision for network states is expressed as follows:\nPeter Zeihan is extremely bullish on the United States. Or at least in comparison to the rest of the world. He doesn't deny the political division and dysfunction (as he says in a quote I excerpt below, \"the Americans are, like, really bad at government\"), but thinks that the natural advantages of the US outweigh those of almost any competitor. The first major advantage he sees is geographical: the core of a continent full of natural resources, with defensible borders and easy internal transportation. The second major advantage is demographic: compared to other first world countries (aside from France, and a few small players like New Zealand), birth-rates in the US have stayed high enough to avoid the worst effects of an aging and shrinking population. That is something that he sees wreaking havoc with other developed countries through the 2020s and 2030s. Japan has been able to mostly cope with an aging and shrinking population (although their economy basically stopped growing in the mid-1990s), but few other countries have their advantages (a very unified and cohesive culture, and starting to prepare and shift their economy decades in advance of crisis hitting). The current strain on Canada's healthcare system is very much in line with his thesis: a wave of retirements from baby boomers with insufficient new workers trained to replace them will be a phenomenon affecting most of the developed world for the foreseeable future. At the same time as this demographic contraction and all the challenges that come with it (labour shortages, liquidity or solvency problems for pension funds and social services), countries will have to adapt to a retreat of globalization. The US has provided the principal security guarantees for international trade (Zeihan explains that this is not just directly from allowing ships to safely cross the ocean but indirectly because countries that don't fear invasion are more willing to specialize instead of insisting that domestic production needs to focus on strategic essentials) but is turning in more of an isolationist direction as they conclude that the global order that made sense during the Cold War doesn't meet their current needs as well. With more of a sense that regional power blocs are up for grabs, Zeihan expects increasing global conflict and decreasing international trade as countries take efforts to shorten and secure their supply chains. Consider how cutting edge computer chips are only made in Taiwan. Now this is seen as a vulnerability in case conflict breaks out there, so other countries are planning for domestic production. This is a duplication of effort that leaves everyone less prosperous under normal circumstances, but lessens the risk of supply chain disruptions leading to shortages. Repeat this story across numerous industries. Importers of basics like food or energy are likely in for a very bad time if his predictions pan out.\nLet's flesh some of these points out a bit. To start with, here is part of the—cheery!—introduction that Zeihan provides:\nThe title of The End of the World is Just the Beginning refers not to the literal end of the world but to the unravelling or fracturing of the international Order (with a capital O; take Bretton Woods as a metonym for the whole system of American hegemony for a sense of what Zeihan means be the Order) that has prevailed in the West since WW2 and in most of the world (aside from very marginal places like North Korea) since the end of the Cold War. He argues that the Order is on its last legs because the conditions under which it was developped no longer obtain.\nAssuming there is a roll-back of globalization, Zeihan draws a straight line from there to severe shortages of basic commodities (up to and including famine, for places that suddenly can't import either enough food or enough fertilizer and energy to grow it themselves) in places that aren't blessed with good access to natural resources. Much of the book goes over specific industries and resources, and how their distribution might change if supply chains are forced to get a lot shorter.\nHere are the keys to success in Zeihan's model:\nThe Americas (both North and South) look pretty good on these points (meeting 2 or 3 out of 4), and so do some select other countries: France, Australia, Japan, Sweden, the UK. On the other hand, China, Korea, and Germany are probably the most reliant on the continuation of globalization as they are export-driven economies that rely on imports for a lot of raw materials and necessities.\nThe End of the World is Just the Beginning has effective explanations on demographic factors and how they are basically locked in at this point (the right time to fix a declining birth rate is twenty years ago...):\n\"Retirees no longer have new income to invest,\" so expect cost of capital (e.g. interest rates on mortgages as a very timely and relevant example) to be higher than the 2010s for a long time. It's not just a shrinking workforce to deal with as the population ages into retirement, but a whole cohort of investors switching from putting money into the market to taking it out. Additionally, older consumers aren't expected to generate as much economic activity. In the US, these effects are somewhat mitigated by having one of the largest Millennial cohorts so the labour market contraction isn't as drastic as elsewhere. In contrast, China is facing a demographic timebomb:\n\"Geographies of success\" and demographics are two themes that Peter Zeihan keeps coming back to. I think these factors are important too, so a lot of what he predicts from them should at least be taken into consideration. However, I don't buy that they are fully deterministic. Necessity is the mother of invention, so while things like energy might get a lot more expensive, I expect countries that are on the losing end of that change (i.e. energy importers) will find ways to tighten their belts and avoid collapse. On the other side, his case for the US coming out on top (no longer a global hegemon, but still enjoying peace and prosperity at home) doesn't wrestle enough with growing political division and animosity, in my opinion. Being self-sufficient in oil and gas is less beneficial if pipelines start getting shut down by state governors making a point, for example (let alone acts of sabotage). And things like the bussing around of illegal immigrants between states that we've seen in the past year seems like a harbinger of the sort of American Anarchy that Balaji describes.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of The End of the World is Just the Beginning is in arguing against the common view that China will be the next global hyperpower/hegemon. Zeihan may or may not be correct about this, but he identifies a lot of structural weaknesses in China (demographics, their financial system, their dependence as an export-driven economy (and importer of oil and food) on the rules-based international order they often seem to undermine) that anyone thinking about these topics should take into account.\nIt is also a very good strategic briefing when it is getting into specifics, like who has copper and where it is processed and used. And copper is only an example, he gets into the strategic geography of several key resources encompassing energy, minerals, and agriculture. For a lot of the metals, there is a recurring story where China is a massive importer, processer, and re-exporter:\nAlong with the strategic geography of key resources, Zeihan offers reality checks on alternative energy and transportation.\nHe is in favour of wind and solar power where the conditions are right, but wants to dispel illusions that the winding down of global trade in energy could be quickly or easily replaced with local sources. Similarly, international shipping has no substitute:\nAs a vivid illustration of this, I looked up some statistics on China's Belt and Road Initiative. At the land port of Khorgas where the rail gauge changes between China and Eurasia, the annual cargo volume is 200,000 TEUs, which is only 0.5% of what the port of Shanghai (the largest in the world, to be fair) processes annually. (see this post for more about maritime trade).\nFor this reason, Zeihan's nightmare scenario for when the roll-back of globalization changes from a slow and steady trend to a rapid collapse is a commercial ship being sunk (as collateral damage of a conflict around the Hormuz Strait or the South China Sea, for example).  According to him, the knock-on effects on insurance would immediately make international shipping a lot more expensive and curtail a lot of volume, with serious consequences to export-driven economies, just-in-time manufacturing, and globally-integrated production that relies on trade in intermediate goods.\nOne of the central geopolitical questions for the 2020s is on how the relative power and influence of China and the United States evolve. Of course, these are not the only countries—I'll cover other countries and regions in this section, don't worry—but understanding how someone thinks about this topic is a good starting point for their geopolitical outlook in general. Both Balaji Srinivasan and Peter Zeihan expect the US to pull back from being the global security guarantor, although they differ on the reason. For Balaji, it will be a consequence of declining state capacity (due to internal division), while for Zeihan it will be a political choice of isolationism as fewer and fewer Americans see the benefit of the current international order. As he wrote in an excerpt I included above, \"the entire concept of the Order is that the United States disadvantages itself economically in order to purchase the loyalty of a global alliance,\" and with the end of the Cold War, he sees a growing, bipartisan decline in belief that this purchase is a good deal for the US anymore. However, it is in China that the starkest differences in their outlooks lie. Balaji expects the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to tighten its control over the country. This won't be great for individual Chinese people, but the unity it brings will allow for the Chinese state to project power globally better than any competitors. In contrast, Zeihan thinks that China has some structural weaknesses that no one will be able to overcome and it will eventually splinter. Foremost among these weaknesses are demographics (\"getting old before they get rich\") and needing to import food, energy, and too many other critical raw materials.\n(If I recall correctly, both authors include the famous opening line from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, though: 分久必合，合久必分 = \"The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.\").\nThese views could be summarized as American Anarchy, CCP Control for Balaji (his words), and Fortress America(s), Chinese Fracture for Zeihan. I'll elaborate on what these views mean below, but first I want to note that laying it out like this allows for a wider possibility space to be conceptualized, as I mentioned in the Introduction:\nOf course, to the above should be added a null hypothesis (scenario 0) that the status quo basically continues as it is. The complete possibility space also includes changes from current conditions in the direction that someone suggests, but of a lesser (or greater!) magnitude.\nRegarding the USA, The Network State has this to say:\nBalaji also contrasts the US to China, writing:\nHe sees the US edging towards some kind of Civil War, part 2. To be clear, this wouldn't necessarily be a shooting war, but perhaps a \"civil cold war\" or some kind of digital conflict between opposing subcultures and political factions. The reason for expecting this is partly from looking at current trends in political polarization and adding in potential economic difficulties:\nCultural changes away from respect for institutions and hierarchies are also a factor:\nPeter Zeihan also expects less US power projection abroad, but due to a democratic choice (on both sides of the aisle) for greater isolationism:\nHe also makes the point that the Americans went for a different approach to hegemony than traditional imperialism because (in the aftermath of World War 2), they had all the room they needed to expand on their own continent and because governing was neither their key interest nor core competence:\nI think this is a good counterpoint to Balaji's very negative outlook for the US. Good government has never really been the main thing that makes the US work and some level of anarchy isn't really a new thing for them—maybe not even necessarily a weakness. Though I'd say Zeihan is too sanguine that political dysfunction in the US won't negate some of the significant advantages it otherwise has (which he rightly identifies!—I agree that the US has a lot going for it and that being slightly ungovernable hasn't kept it down in the past).\nMore internal division in the US would favour Balaji's predictions over Zeihan's, though. Something like a state governor openly defying a federal law (like threatening to use the National Guard or state police to arrest federal law enforcement if they didn't back down) or like a ballot measure for secession appearing in one or more states (even if it didn't pass).\nOne big question is whether the US dollar will hold on as the global reserve currency. Zeihan doesn't see a good alternative, so even while the US retreats to a greater degree of isolationism, there won't be a new hegemon to take their place in a financial sense (or a military/security one either). A shift to other world currencies would line up more with the predictions in The Network State.\nRegarding China, Balaji's emphasis is on their government's ability to accomplish its goals:\nThe point about AI, also discussed above, is that it could offset some deficiencies in loyal manpower. His view that China will become stronger is in no way an endorsement of their methods, however. He thinks that the CCP will be increasingly authoritarian—and effective at this, thanks to their embrace of new technologies—not only over people in China, but over the entire Chinese diaspora:\nZeihan is far less impressed by the Chinese government's managerial abilities. He claims that even things that look like strengths, like their high industrial production, are a symptom of their economic system not being as good as a market economy at matching supply and demand:\nObviously Zeihan puts a lot more weight on fundamentals like demographics and secure access to critical resources (importing oil from 10,000 km away through a couple of vulnerable chokepoints is anything but secure!), and thinks China is headed for turmoil on this basis. Whereas Balaji's view is that emerging technologies will give the CCP the state capacity to maintain control. Indeed, the second half of 2022 has seen some crises start to pile up in China, ranging from financial (bank runs and real estate bubbles, not that they are unique in the latter), to ones related to natural resources (drought leading to black-outs as hydropower dries up, very much related to a recent post here), to rare public displays of discontent. It's at least possible that these crises (especially if they persist instead of turning out to be rather transient) are related to some of the structural weaknesses Zeihan sees in China. However, so far Chairman Xi still seems to be firmly in control, so I don't think we can judge which author is closer to the mark yet.\nJust like Balaji underrates the importance of population (and agriculture, I'd say), I think Zeihan has too static a view of force projection. Right now, he lists the US, Russia, UK, France, Turkey, Japan as the only nations that can operate navies far enough afield to secure resources. But how can he be so sure other countries (obviously China, but also others like Korea which has tons of shipbuilding) won't develop those capabilities if the need is great enough?\nRegarding Russia, I don't recall that Balaji's book had much in the way of specific comments or predictions. Zeihan's book clearly had some edits that were made just before publication to touch on the invasion of Ukraine. In spite of having an almost-terminal demographic outlook, he thinks Russia has enough other strengths that they can't be counted out:\nOn this point, note how many Russian oligarchs derive their fortunes from strategic essentials like iron/steel, oil & gas, and fertilizer.\nBruno Maçães' Dawn of Eurasia offers yet another view of the prospects for Russia and the surrounding region. If there is a continued shift of the global economic center of gravity to Asia, while Europe remains a strong consumer market, then sitting astride a land-based trade route between them and having plentiful energy and mineral resources to sell both east and west will be a very strong strategic position. Build-out of the Belt and Road infrastructure would also mitigate at least some of the weaknesses Zeihan sees in China, as they could access a lot of what they need overland through territory they control. However, if I understand correctly, Zeihan would disagree with Maçães on a few points: he doesn't think east Asian economic growth is sustainable (too indebted/leveraged), he doesn't think European demographics will maintain consumer demand, and the efficiency drop from water transport to road and rail means that the latter isn't a substitute for the former if geopolitical chaos imperils ocean-going trade (as noted above in the example of Khorgas).\nOther countries I won't spend as long on as the superpowers in this review. However, I think it's worth sharing some of these authors predictions for various countries and regions to be able to evaluate the accuracy of their models as events unfold.  Because Peter Zeihan expects a trend of growing isolationism from the American political system and less global security as a result, he predicts a decline in global trade. Decades of globalization has allowed for a lot of specialization and gains from trade, but also a lot of dependence on its continuation; some places are more exposed than others, though:\nPlaces that are likely to do well (at least relatively—most will be at least somewhat poorer if these things come to pass), are those that are close to self-sufficient in vital resources and self-defense. First of all, Fortress North America (with Colombian/Chilean/Argentinian and maybe Australian annexes) is pretty viable in Zeihan's analysis:\nIn Europe, the old quip about NATO was that its purpose was to \"keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.\" Because he expects a US retrenchment, he also expects a less united Europe:\nOne of Balaji's themes is that the nation-state model is becoming obsolete, so he doesn't get as much into analyzing the prospects of existing countries. His book provides a useful reminder that a lot of non-state actors (e.g. corporations, cryptocurrencies, organized social networks) should be included when thinking about geopolitics. He also considers that non-aligned countries will have a vital niche to fill between his predictions for American Anarchy and CCP Control. India is one of the foremost examples of a country that is well-positioned to chart its own course. Their improving infrastructure is one example of the strength of their position. Even more than India the country, Balaji says he's bullish on the Indian diaspora.\nBefore wrapping up this section, I want to discuss manufacturing and agriculture.  The stochastic supply chain challenges of the past few years need to be taken into account in any forward-looking planning and predictions. Zeihan certainly sees this as the new normal:\nThis makes things like machine shops and 3D printing more advantageous:\n3D printing also fits well with the worldview of The Network State. It envisions a future where the continued advance of technology has a lot more things digital first even if they ultimately get materialized in the physical world. Balaji expects more manufacturing to be automated and on-demand. This is also well suited for network states that don't have a lot of physical territory since it can have a very efficient physical footprint.\nOn the other hand, I don't think Balaji has enough appreciation for the importance of agriculture. A network state with an archipelago of small, scattered physical territory (he specifically says some of these territories could be merely a cul-de-sac or even smaller) might work for digital nomads who can work from anywhere, but it's not going to be an exporter of agricultural commodities. And advances in biotech and efforts towards a circular economy are poised to make agriculture even more important, not just for food but for materials and perhaps energy (for one example, the market for polylactic acid, a bio-plastic, is growing by 10-15% per year). Zeihan, by contrast, sees agriculture as being of existential importance:\nAt the end of the day, it was valuable to read these two books back-to-back. Reading one of them in isolation probably would have been more convincing, but hearing both author's arguments gave me space to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of their assumptions and also contemplate other possible scenarios as I've tried to explain above. God only knows what the future actually holds, so rather than treating either book as an authoritative geopolitical forecast, I'm treating them as potential scenarios to contemplate and permutate in my own planning (for things like investments, career opportunities that require relocation, etc.). Combining their scenarios, it shouldn't be unthinkable (nor do I think it's likely, just not outside the realm of possibility) for any major power of the moment to unravel to some degree: China, Russia, the US (e.g. certain states going their own way to the point that there are internal border controls), or the EU (e.g. countries ditching the Euro or leaving the Schengen free movement area—Brexit was about the UK leaving the EU, but they weren't part of the Euro or Schengen to begin with, so it isn't necessarily the start of a trend the way a truly core member leaving would be). At the moment, there are serious signs of division in the US (e.g. taking the longest to elect a Speaker of the House since the pre-Civil War days), China is dealing with a serious Covid wave after their zero-Covid approach became no longer tenable, Russia is looking weak in Ukraine, and the EU has been facing an energy crunch (made slightly easier by a mild winter). So nowhere is really looking like it will win at the moment. On the other hand, I don't think it's wise to underestimate the human propensity to muddle through in times of necessity, or the sheer inertia of the status quo.\nThis section is for material from The Network State and The End of the World is Just the Beginning that didn't really fit anywhere else in this post, but was too fun or interesting to leave out.\nOne of Balaji's examples of a moral innovation (\"One Commandment\") to build community around is the idea of a digital Sabbath (previously discussed here):\nI actually saw in the news recently that a village in India has sort of tried this (for 1.5 hours per day).\nZeihan's book had a bit to say about the Mekong River, the topic of one of my posts from last year:\nI also found this paragraph from his book very amusing:\nIn fact, I'd say there are some major similarities with Smil's style in terms of analyses rooted in fundamentals of available energy and material resources, (although Zeihan's writing style is much more conversational and even flippant in places). An example of this type of analysis is some of his points about renewable energy and the large footprint it requires. This increases the hinterland area that a city needs to tap into, or, conversely, decreases the sustainable population density. This makes me think of a point I heard on a podcast (I believe it was an interview with Alain Bertaud) point about the biggest value of cities being the way they bring a large and diverse labour market together: workers have more bargaining power and a chance to specialize and switch to a role they're best suited for; employers have a good choice of qualified candidates. The key is the size of the catchment area (determined by transportation technology for a reasonable commute) times its density. Zeihan makes the point that the larger the city, the more dependent it is on stable, global trade: to draw resources (including food) from further afield, and to support that high a degree of specialization:\nBut Balaji's focus on technological change would probably counter that the rise of remote work might make it easier for people to physically spread out while still getting some of those advantages of a large integrated labour market. A synthesis of these views might be a future that is more digitally interconnected, but physically disconnected (e.g. intercontinental VR meetings and even virtual \"tourism\"); it's not impossible that we could get a degree of deglobalization in physical goods (at least so far as routine bulk trade goes) while media and digital goods & services can still go international (perhaps with some personal travel and small packages that can be delivered by plane continuing as well). That is,9 deglobalization colliding with dematerialization trends.\nI'll begin this final section with a litany of recent events litany of events that show why paying attention to geopolitics is timely. Maybe the status quo will win out, but things certainly seem to be in flux right now.\nFor futher reading, here are a couple of pieces in conversation about The Network State; and here is a defense of the position that the world order headed by liberal democracies isn't or needn't be in decline.\nHere are a couple of infographics that are very relevant to The End of the World is Just the Beginning, one about demographics and one showing the global distribution of major steel producers.\nLastly, I tried to brainstorm some actionable ideas if you buy into some of these geopolitical forecasts:\nBeyond any specific recommendations, recognizing that there's a lot of uncertainty right now it's always good (for countries and individuals and groups/organizations in between) to know who your friends are and where your necessities come from.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Annual retrospective\n2022 was not a very active year here on The Drafting Table (because it was a very active year at home and at work). I had seven posts, the fewest of any year since I started this blog. However, I've got a backlog of something like 10 partial drafts, so I hope to post at least a little bit more in 2023.\nI did manage to find time for reading, getting through 22 books in '22. A few of them served as starting points for a couple of in-depth posts on water resources in East Asia and rapid improvements in machine learning. I hope to do at least one more lengthy review post on a couple of books, as well as some mini-reviews like I did last year of some of the other books I read, so keep an eye out for those.\nHere is the full list of my posts from this year:\nAnd here are links for the past couple of year-end round-ups (which can also take you back further): 2021, 2020.\nThis past year I got to build a few unique pieces of furniture. I've already shared the tensegrity footstool and tripod lamp (here). A more recent project was a privacy screen / room divider, pictured below. It has a softwood frame and the panels are filled in with pseudo-vintage posters of botanical prints that we found at a cool coffeehouse in Nova Scotia.\nI'll also include a comment I made on LinkedIn regarding the labour market here to refer back to in a year or two to see how it panned out:\n\"Using LinkedIn's 41 ideas for 2023 (https://lnkd.in/g-Wb8A4S) as a jumping-off point, it looks like the year ahead has the potential to be very chaotic in the labour market. There are a lot of competing factors pushing in all directions, so it is hard to predict what the net effect will be. Some of the factors I'm watching are:\nPersonally, I think the wisest course in the face of this kind of uncertainty is to keep your eyes open and maintain optionality as much as possible. Employers shouldn't rush into layoffs and workers shouldn't rush into unionization drives and strike actions. Until some of these dynamics shake out, you don't want to paint yourself into a corner.\"\nPermalink",

    "content": "The topic of AI/ML (machine learning) is getting a lot of buzz right now. That makes this book review pretty timely.\nSeven Games: A Human History by Oliver Roeder is a book that came out this year. It is about board and card games, the seven alluded to in the title—Checkers, Chess, Go, Backgammon, Poker, Scrabble, Bridge—along with some philosophical musings about game-playing in general. On the latter point, Roeder discusses how games provide a constrained space for creative play and exploration, that can impart skills and lessons which can then be taken out and applied in the broader world. This is very relevant to one of the main themes of Seven Games, on the development of computer programs that can play these games, eventually getting strong enough to challenge even top human players (at most of the games in the book, at least). These games have provided a constrained problem space for the development of AI programs (with techniques getting ported over to more general problems). The history that Roeder recounts may also provide a useful peek into the changes this technology could bring to the workplace and other facets of our lives.\nOverall, this was a fun book to read. It had a nice blend of the history of the games, details about their mechanics and strategy and complexity, a run-down of the effort to conquer each one with code, and big picture thoughts about games and about the future of automation. I appreciate that the author played all of these games, some (e.g. Scrabble) at a pretty high level. He also has a PhD in game theory and a lot of experience writing; Roeder was certainly the right person to write this book.\nThis excerpt gives a good overview of the book as a whole, from the philosophical point in the first two sentences to the descriptions of the elements of strategy that each game adds (emphasis added):\nBefore getting into the \"human versus machine\" part of the book, I'll first spend a bit of time on what Roeder has to say about the history and strategy of some of the games he covers (checkers and chess hardly need introduction). Go is my favourite game featured in this book, so I appreciated his description of it:\nOther interesting things that this book mentioned about Go were: the last game of the Japanese master Shusai in 1938, a grand event that toured around the country and took weeks and weeks to play; a poem from the Han dynasty by Ma Rong (see the end of this article for a partial translation); and an aside that,\nBackgammon has an ancient history, with roots reaching back more than four thousand years to the Royal Game of Ur. It was popularized in North America (if only for a few generations) by a Russian aristocrat, Alexis Obolensky, who fled to the US after the Revolution in his homeland.\nRegarding Poker, Roeder points out that it is not only a game of chance, but one where not all one's cards are on the table, so to speak. This aspect is an important consideration in game theory (emphasis added):\nScrabble is a game that Roeder has played competitively, so the chapter on it was quite interesting, even though the game itself has never really taken my fancy. I thought his perspective that each allowed word is a \"rule\" of Scrabble very insightful:\nSo memorization is one necessary (but not sufficient) condition for doing well at Scrabble. Studying the short words (107 allowable two-letter combos, 1082 allowable three-letter combos, and 4218 allowable four-letter combos) is the first step to getting good at Scrabble. This lets you churn tiles you don't need while waiting for a great combo that uses the full rack. Scrabble champions need a vocabulary far beyond what anyone uses in day-to-day life (although they don't need to know the definitions). A mere 850 words is considered by some to be enough to get started in a language like English. In contrast,\nAnother crucial skill you need to get good at to succeed in Scrabble is anagramming, which Roeder demonstrates in this chapter using well-selected examples. Memorization and anagramming are both areas where computers have an advantage, but they aren't where Scrabble strategy ends. Players also need to have a good sense of how to steward their tiles: when to save them and when to spend them. In fact, an early program called Maven influenced a change in Scrabble strategy on this point, from aiming for high turnover (trying to get rid of as many tiles as possible each turn) to holding back promising tiles for really high-scoring words.\nThe chapter on Bridge was a window into a strange and vanishing subculture. I'm assuredly not alone in my generation in never having played it; the New York Times ended its Bridge column in 2015. Its rise in popularity was around the same time period as Backgammon (although promoted by a Vanderbilt rather than a Russian aristocrat). The norm in the high-level Bridge world is for teams to have a sponsor (who is usually one of the team members, it seems), and it's reportedly not unheard of for good players at major tournaments to be making five figures for a few days of play. The impression one gets is that it is predominately played by a small circle of high society.\nAs for aspects of the game, it incorporates randomness, hidden information, and teamwork:\nBridge has been difficult for computers to crack partly because of the way teammates need to work together with only very limited and formalized communication—and probably also in part because its lower popularity has motivated less effort to develop a winning program.\nOne of the important elements to understand about Bridge is that the bidding phase is simultaneously about competing with your opponents and passing information (according to an elaborate set of conventions about what different bids mean) to your partner:\nComputers aren't there yet. But for the other games, impressively strong programs have been developed. Quite a bit of Seven Games is about the history of that development, which I'll share some of the highlights of in the subsequent paragraphs of this review.\nThe first chapter is about Checkers. The man-vs-machine match-up it discussed took place in 1992 or 1993 between a pro player named Tinsley who'd only lost 3 times since 1950 and a program called Chinook. I'll discuss the techniques a bit more later, but basically Chinook took advantage of computers' capacity to store huge amounts of data and also search through or analyze many possibilities quickly. It had a complete database of all possible endgames once only 7 pieces were left, and much of the 8-piece endgame was also fully mapped. So if it could get to the endgame, it would be able to play it out to the end without any mistakes (aside from errors in the database, which there were some). In this match-up, Tinsley won 4, lost 2, and drew 33 games.\nOn a checkers board there are 5x1020 possible arrangements. The next two games covered in Seven Games, Chess and Go, have dozens or hundreds of orders of magnitude more complexity (in terms of their possibility space):\nThese are not calculated exactly the same way as the number for Checkers, but as an approximation (considering average number of moves and average length of games), we have around 5x1061 possible unique games of Chess and 6x10239  possible unique games of Go (calculating the possible arrangements on a Go board—361 positions that can be black, white, or empty—gives 1.7x10172); not all of these arrangements will be valid, of course, but on the other hand, because Go pieces are placed rather than moved as in Checkers or Chess, the requirement for a consistent game history prunes less of the possibility space). The astronomical complexity of these games means a database of solved endgames like Chinook had wouldn't be as much of an edge. I'll say more about the techniques that were used later in this post.\nThe greater complexity of these games meant that the seminal man-vs-machine match-ups occurred later than they did for Checkers. For Chess, Roeder discusses the match between IBM's Deep Blue and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, in which Deep Blue won 3 games, lost 2, and drew 1. He also discusses some earlier history: the Mechanical Turk (which was a fraud) and El Ajedrecista (which worked, but was restricted to a simple end-game scenario). For Go, the match-up he focused on took place in 2016. It was between Lee Sedol, an 18-time international champion, and Google's AlphaGo. There is a documentary about this tournament. The program won 4 games and lost 1, but the game that Lee Sedol won is considered a masterpiece of play.\nThe rest of the games in Seven Games incorporate elements of chance and imperfect information. That makes them much more challenging for programming AI. Still, there has been steady progress.\nFor Backgammon, Roeder discusses a match between a programmed called TD-Gammon and a human player (Robertie) in 1991. The current reigning computer program (eXtreme Gammon) is a successor; both use an artificial neural network approach.\nWhen it comes to Poker, Roeder doesn't cover a seminal match-up, but estimates that there were programs that could be competitive against good human players shortly before 2010. He lists Polaris as an example. A more recent program, Cepheus, plays \"almost perfect\" heads-up limit poker as of 2015. There are many variants of Poker, however, and the ones that are no-limit or involve more than 2 players are more complex:\nThere are 3.2 million (i.e. 3.2x106) distinct possibilities for Scrabble draws, and its complexity grows further when you consider the number of words that can be anagrammed from a set of drawn tiles plus all of the options for where to place the word on the board. In 1998, a notable Scrabble game was played at the New York Times building between a program called Maven and a human player; that was not Maven's debut, however, as it had played in tournaments as early as 1986. The top modern Scrabble program is apparently one called Quackle.\nBasically, from 1990 – 2020 all of these games went from having non-existent or not very good computer programs to ones that can win, even against top-rated players. The one exception might be Bridge—probably due to a mix of its complexity and relatively-limited popularity. Roeder calculates that there are 5.3x1028 possible deals of a single Bridge hand. Of course the bidding system explained above and the need to understand your partner very well add layers of extra strategy on top of simply playing out the cards.\nNow that I've written about the games and their strategies, and the timeline of the development of competitive computer programs for them (which seems to be correlated with the complexity of each game), I want to cover what we can learn about AI research from this book. This aspect of Seven Games makes it a very timely new book.\nThe history of how each game was attacked provides a decent overview of several approaches/techniques that have been applied in AI research. First of all, searching quickly through rapidly-branching possible sequences of moves (and going deeper than a human mind can manage without losing track of all the branches) is something computers excel at:\nThis approach is especially good for early-game and end-game situations, where the possibility space is more limited. For example, if a computer works backwards from endgame states and builds a database, those can be played from memory instead of calculating each time; high-level human players also spend a lot of time studying endgame scenarios, but the possibilities multiply very quickly. This was a significant part of Chinook's edge at Checkers:\nAs the complexity of a game increases, though, even computers have to work smarter, not harder. Claude Shannon, the famous computer/information theorist, contrasted two possible approaches:\nShannon's Type B would need to incorporate expert knowledge/heuristics to focus on evaluating the most promising moves. This approach, a \"combination of speedy calculation within human-defined parameters is sometimes called “good old-fashioned AI,”\" according to Roeder (he uses the abbreviation GOFAI).\nOne of the strongest current chess programs, called Stockfish, was developped following this type of approach. It has the additional innovation of crowdsourced iteration:\nBut GOFAI is being edged out by a new paradigm: machine learning (ML). In this approach, instead of encoding expert insights or databases of early- and end-game states, large neural networks are applied to pattern recognition in truly enormous datasets. Stockfish was beat by AlphaZero (from the same team that made AlphaGo), a program using ML, in 2017. Convincingly. Using the leverage of recognizing the most promising moves, \"AlphaZero searches only about eighty thousand positions per second, compared to Stockfish’s seventy million.\" However, it has a very costly (in computational terms, and also electricity) training process. AlphaZero gets trained/learns by playing against itself. In doing so, it independently re-discovered a lot of textbook openings such as the Queen's Gambit and the Sicilian Defense during its training.\nMachine learning can be thought of as a way of recognizing and applying patterns that comes at things from the opposite direction as traditional statistical approaches. To be specific, when applying something like a regression model, you need to start with some structure (e.g. linear, quadratic, exponential, logistic, etc.) and try to explain the bulk of the variability in the data with as few parameters/degrees of freedom as possible; going to too high a degree of a polynomial without a justified (i.e. knowledge of causal mechanisms) reason for doing so can result in overfitting (discussed in this post), where the calibration data is well matched by the model, but extrapolation or interpolation can yield nonsensical results. In contrast, machine learning (at least the dominant neural-network based approach) avoids an assumed underlying structure and uses an extremely large number of parameters. Overfitting is still a potential pitfall to avoid, but given that it's usually applied to enormous (and massively multi-dimensional) datasets, the profusion of degrees of freedom can pick up on even relatively minor patterns. It is also able to match multiple inputs to multiple outputs, versus a few inputs to a single output in a traditional regression. Something to be careful of is that in a traditional regression, you can usually decipher meaning from the parameter values whereas in machine learning, the interpretation of parameter weights is basically opaque—you don't get a clear understanding of how inputs map to outputs so the model behaviour can catch you by surprise.\nBasically, ML is a 'black-box' technique: you can see the inputs and outputs, but in between it's not clear what is going on or at least it can't easily be related to a mechanistic explanation. Other data science tools, in contrast, can provide explanatory insight into a problem (e.g. in principal component analysis it can be determined how strongly the original variables contribute to the new major axis) or take advantage of known causal mechanisms (e.g. a Kalman filter incorporates assumptions from a physical model of the system). A data scientist friend of mine that I've talked to about this subject prefers techniques that aren't black boxes, at least for systems that interact with the physical world, for reasons such as these. And here's what Roeder has to say:\nIn spite of these limitations as a 'black-box', ML is a very powerful technique that is getting applied to more and more use cases. One crucial example is AlphaFold (by the same team that made AlphaGo), which has made breakthroughs in protein folding (I plan to have more to say about this in a future post). Another area of active research for applying AI/ML is fusion energy. Needless to say, a breakthrough there would be an absolute game-changer.\nOne of the reasons games have been a venue for a lot of early ML successes is related to the availability of training data. Machine learning models get 'trained' by tuning their millions or billions of parameters to get inputs to match the correct outputs. This process requires a lot of computing resources (i.e. time on super-computers) and electricity. It also requires (generally—there might be exceptions in techniques used at the cutting edge) good quality data where the inputs and outputs are correctly matched up. When it comes to games, training data can be generated by having the computer play itself a mind-boggling number of times, then boot-strap a sense of strategy by finding patterns in what types of moves led to wins or losses. Generating training data, while perhaps costly in terms of electricity and computer time, is still far cheaper than collecting data from the real world and validating its correctness. For this reason, I expect tasks that can be done entirely on a computer to be more susceptible to AI than tasks that interface with the physical world.\nSeven Games provides some quantification of just how costly these ML models are to develop (although that may decrease with further research):\nAlphaGo is getting a lot of my attention in this post, both because I like the game it was applied to and because the team behind it has a truly-impressive track record. However, the approach of getting the computer to play games against itself to generate training data has been used by other programs too:\nI'll return to this topic of the need for good-quality training data near the end of this post, but for now I want to pivot to another topic Roeder covers in Seven Games: how human players have adapted to computers getting so good. He views these adaptations, I think correctly, as a bit of a preview of how the spread of AI/ML programs to more endeavours might affect various jobs and society at large.\nOne adaptation when competing against a program is to do something unexpected—trying to make a play that's outside of the program's expert heuristics or training data:\nAnother adaptive strategy is to work with the computer, such as by training against a program that is as strong or stronger than any human opponent you're likely to face:\nThe term 'centaur' used here really stood out to me. I also liked the emphasis that these programs are still tools. Their winning records can be impressive, even daunting, but they lack agency of their own. An interesting question is whether they will be tools that everyone has access to, or if the vanguard of the arms race will be kept exclusive such that it will be very difficult to be on top of your game (vis-à-vis other human players) if you don't have access to the latest and greatest software for practice and study.\nAt the same time, having all the top players merely trying to replicate the moves that a program has determined are near-optimal can result in rather boring gameplay. This is perhaps more noticeable in some games than in others:\nFiguring things out for oneself can also be a lot more satisfying:\nThis quote comes back to some of the limits of black-box models, too.\nI'll wrap up the book review portion of this post with a final excerpt from Seven Games that relates some of these issues back to the world beyond games:\nHaving discussed Seven Games and its themes, especially as they relate to AI/ML research, I wanted to finish this post with some other considerations on this rapidly-unfolding field. I'm very far from an expert on this, but I've tried to stay abreast of some prominent developments and can at least offer some links to explore further.\nOne of my take-aways from reading Roeder's book regarding machine learning systems was the need for good quality training data. With games, as discussed above, it can be generated by having the computer play against itself. The next easiest source is collecting data that has already been digitized (e.g. scraping the web). Going out and collecting data from the physical world involves the greatest time and expense. For this reason, I expect jobs that mostly revolve around digital content are the most susceptible to disruption from AI in the near future. Conversely, a potential expanding sector of jobs will be in producing high-quality digital data—think proof-reading or error-checking scanned/uploaded documents, or taking a variety of measurements in the real world to fill in gaps in databases. Additionally, companies will probably continue to find sneaky ways to crowd-source the validation of datasets (for the unaware, this has been one of the purposes of CAPTCHAs).\nSomething else to keep in mind regarding training data is the old rule \"Garbage in, garbage out\" (possibly mitigated somewhat by statistical techniques). For example, Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate text that sounds very natural. However, they're generally trained from what people have written all over the internet, so there's no guarantee that their written output will be good, true, or beautiful.\nMachine learning tools for content generation (especially text and photos) are getting a ton of buzz right now. Here is a good explainer article about the technology. It covers things at a general level, so it can be good for understanding various specific software in this category better.  It explains how classification (e.g. image recognition) and generation (e.g. of a new image) tasks are closely related. It gives advice to approach using these tools the way you would a search engine, crafting the right prompt/query to return the most relevant results; the difference is that a search engine returns results from actually-existing content, whereas these new ML tools search the 'latent space' of possible content. I have another how-to from the same author, Jon Stokes, shared below.\nThe way that ML content generation engines search through latent space reminds me of the Mirror of Galadriel, from Lord of the Rings: it \"shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass\". This article also uses a 'magical mirror' metaphor to discuss coming up with useful prompts for an ML model. It's important to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor: these models use powerful statistical techniques, not magic. Aside from tips on crafting useful prompts, the article has valuable cautions about the limitations of these ML models:\nBecause these content engines are tools without agency of their own, the key ethical issues relate to how they are used. As mentioned above, one possible misuse would be to gain an unfair edge over people who don't have access to the latest and greatest version. Another unethical use is for deceit, as in 'deepfakes' and similar—generating images or even videos of things that \"have not yet come to pass\" in an effort to convince people they did happen. This article goes into detail about that danger and related ones:\nIn this excerpt, high quality training data is seen as a bottleneck, as discussed previously. But scraping images from the public internet can bring a lot of garbage in (and also get tangled up in some copyright concerns). The last paragraph anticipates an arms race between producing and detecting fake media. It's time to get serious about epistemology if you aren't already.\nFinally, here are some other links for further reading and exploration:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Travel, geopolitics, and water—this post is a review of two books that sit at the convergence of several of my interests. It can also be seen as the inland accompaniment to this post covering coastal areas in the same general region.\nThe River at the Centre of the World: A Journey Up the Yangtze, and Back in Chinese Time by Simon Winchester and The River's Tale: A Year on the Mekong, by Edward Gargan both are travelogues of trips on East Asian rivers that the authors took in the 1990s. These were used bookstore finds (by my wife), but even though it has been decades since they were written, I feel that their subject matter is as timely as ever (in part because they show how much that region has changed since then, but for many other reasons as well). Between these two books, I enjoyed Simon Winchester's more. Gargan's style was too florid and baroque for my tastes, and he also has less of a sense of some of the technical details (about boats and river stages) that left me wanting. Both authors were journalists with a lot of experience reporting from Asia. Simon Winchester, for example, was based in Hong Kong for over a decade (before the handover).\nThe Yangtze basin has an area of 1,745,000 square kilometers and an average flow of 76,365 million cubic metres per month. In June, the monthly discharge reaches 136,756 million cubic metres. It is one of the top five rivers in the world by flow. The Mekong sits just outside the top ten, with an average flow of 41,100 cubic metres per month from a watershed area of 787,260 square kilometers. Its peak monthly flow comes in September and is 108,000 million cubic metres. Both rivers have their minimum monthly flow in February; the Yangtze falls to 27% of its average flow, while the Mekong falls to 1% of its average flow. (These stats come from the same source as I used in this post, which also mentions both of these rivers).\nBefore getting into the books, I want to share some useful geographical context. Both of these rivers arise in the Tibetan plateau—as do a number of other highly-important rivers in Asia. Between regional rivalries (especially between India and China), the politics of water resources (witness the turmoil around Ethiopia's new mega-dam), and the upcoming (uncertain timing, but soon in actuarial terms) succession of the Dalai Lama, this could be a very contentious region in the years ahead.\nAs seen in the above map, the Yangtze and Mekong run very close together in mountainous western China. In fact, they are only 50 km apart at their closest proximity, and the Salween and Irrawaddy aren't far away either. These short distances between major rivers (all rank within the top dozen on the continent) really makes one wonder if water transfer/diversion project (dams and tunnels) have been considered between them—a high-stakes move, to be sure, but in view of how stressed water resources are there, I'm not sure it can be ruled out that someone would attempt it. This area where the Yangtze, Mekong, and Salween run in parallel, steep-sloped valleys is reputed for its natural beauty and is protected as a UNESCO heritage site and a Chinese national park.\nAnother thing to note about the geographical context is the population density. Almost half a billion people live in these two watersheds. However, the distribution is far from uniform. The full length of the Yangtze River lies within China, and it crosses the Heihe-Tengchong line on its journey to the sea. Well over 90% of the population of China lives to the east of this line; the upper Yangtze watershed and other areas to the west are very sparsely populated in comparison to central and coastal parts of China. The Mekong is a trans-boundary river (it flows through and/or forms part of the border of China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam), but has a similar dynamic with the densest population in its lower reaches.\nThese aspects of the geography certainly show up in the books. The main body of this review will be organized geographically, so the above context should be kept in mind. I'll start at the mouth of the Yangtze and cover some parts that stood out from The River at the Centre of the World, then pivot and follow the Mekong past significant places from The River's Tale. This approach follows the direction of travel of Winchester and Gargan, respectively. Note that their paths crossed (albeit a few years apart) in the upper watersheds. Both authors visited Lijiang (on the Yangtze) in Yunnan and Chamdo  (on the Mekong) in Tibet, because they are significant settlements close to both rivers. Simon Winchester made his trip in 1994 (but noted some things that had changed in the interim period in the second edition from 2006) and Edward Gargan made his trip in 1998.\nTo help keep myself oriented as I was reading, I put some placemarks in Google Earth showing locations mentioned in each book. The first one is looking southeast from the Tibetan plateau, while the second is a more normal orientation with North at the top:\nHaving taken care of some introductory material, on to the books! I'll be focusing on impressions and interesting facts that stood out to me while I was reading, along with themes and trends that seem significant (especially with the benefit of 2+ decades of further developments to compare to) in a geopolitical sense.\nThe River at the Centre of the World actually starts in New England. Winchester visited an elderly man whose family had fled China in the first half of the 2oth century (as so many did) to see a priceless painted scroll in his private collection. This scroll is 53 feet in length and depicts the entire length of the Yangtze River. Seeing it was part of what inspired him to take this journey. The subtitle of the book, A Journey Up the Yangtze, and Back in Chinese Time, alludes to the fact that the pace of modernization and industrialization had been much faster in coastal China compared to the interior of the country, so a journey upriver was—at the time!—akin to seeing how things used to be in the country as a whole.\nSimon Winchester describes how the Yangtze river divides China like a belt (North versus South) but also unifies the civilization. He notes that not only is it the heartland of Chinese civilization (although the centre of political power has often lain elsewhere, as it currently does), but is globally significant, with around 1 in every 12 of all people living in the watershed.\nOn his journey, he started from Hong Kong and travelled by ship to the estuary just east of Shanghai, so he could enter the river properly. He noted that the Spratlys and Paracels were just becoming an issue at that time. Even back in 1994, there were 1,000 ships per day passing through the mouth of the estuary. Shanghai is now the busiest port in the world. That initial trip by boat from Hong Kong to Shanghai was a very fitting way to begin the journey, as competition between these two cities is a major theme of the book.  He predicted that Hong Kong would be eclipsed after the handover (basically playing the New Orleans to Shanghai's New York, i.e. as a gateway primarily to the south instead of the pre-eminent port of China) due to Shanghai's strategic location at the mouth of \"the river at the centre of the world\". Even back in colonial times, there was a recognition of Shanghai's value:\nOne detail that Winchester mentioned as he travelled upriver was about the severely endangered (possibly extinct in the years since he wrote his book) Yangtze dolphin. It used to be associated with a goddess, but after the Great Leap Forward that tried to erase old superstitions, they started to be hunted. With devastating effects.\nAs I mentioned above, one of the things that I appreciated about Winchester's writing is that he seemed attuned to technical details, such as quantifying tidal ranges or flood stages at various locations. Here is his description of the Yangtze's hydrology, which shows why flooding is such a threat:\nAdditionally, the precipitation is highly seasonal due to the monsoon. These factors combine to make epic floods possible. However, he does have a theory (slightly on the conspiratorial side) that the Beijing government exaggerated reports of flooding during his 1995 trip, as what he was seeing on the ground (or on the river, rather) didn't look as bad or as widespread as what the news was depicting; their alleged motivation for this kind of exaggeration (if that's what it was—my home city has also experienced floods and it might not look like much if you go several blocks away from the waterfront, but having key arterial streets submerged is a genuine impact) was to build support for the 3 Gorges Dam under construction it the time (a topic I'll return to below).\nOne of the big cities along the river in central China (but still in the lowlands before any dams are reached) has gained global notoriety in recent years since the publication of The River at the Centre of the World: Wuhan.  So I read the chapter or two that Winchester spent there with great interest. Wuhan is a tri-city at an important junction on the Yangtze. It was where early rail lines crossed the river so it became an intermodal hub. And it was where the Railway Protection Movement broke out in 1910, leading to the rebellion that toppled the Qing dynasty. The city's revolutionary bona fides are further bolstered by a famous swim that Chairman Mao took there. Simon's guide, Lily (not her real name, for obvious reasons), was vocal about her feelings for Wuhan:\nMao himself wrote a poem on the occasion of his swim at Wuhan, part of which goes like this:\nThe aspirations for a grand dam are obvious even then (the mid-1950s). Winchester discusses how the control of water has been a perennial topic in Chinese philosophy, giving hydraulic engineering mega-projects a symbolic significance as well as a practical one:\nHeading up the river, Simon Winchester briefly notes cities that were, however briefly, the capital of China (or at least the seat of government for claimants). The sheer number of these between 1850 – 1950 illustrates how tumultuous this period was. The rulers had to relocate especially frequently during the Japanese occupation and the civil war that followed. Wuhan, for example, was the capital of one rival faction of the nationalists. Nanjing (a city weighted with tragic history) was the capital multiple times for multiple entities: the Taiping rebellion, the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek, and the Japanese puppet/collaborator regime. Further upstream, Chongqing was the Nationalist capital during part of the war with Japan and also, briefly, during the Chinese civil war (as were Chengdu and Xichang). And these are only the ones within the Yangtze watershed—the full list is even longer.\nFrom reading The River at the Centre of the World, I definitely got a much better sense of Chinese geography (within the Yangtze watershed, but that is a large and important part of the country as a whole). One part that stood out was Sichuan. It is a large and fertile inland basin, separated from central China by the mountain range that the Three Gorges cut through. Sichuan means 'four rivers' (compare to Mesopotamia meaning 'between the [two] rivers' or Punjab meaning 'five rivers'). This excerpt describes the rugged terrain between Yichang (where the mountain range begins, and near the location of the Three Gorges Dam) and Chongqing (a major city in the Sichuan basin, although it is now a province-level municipality instead of being part of Sichuan province):\n(In metric units, the slope here is 0.65 metres per km). One of the legacies of this book is that Winchester travelled through these gorges by boat before they were flooded by the Three Gorges Dam. Before the construction of the dam, this section was navigable only with great risk and difficulty; prior to the 20th century trackers would pull ships up through the rapids but even with the advent of powered vessels it was no picnic.\nTo the West of the Sichuan basin lie even more formidable mountain ranges, the leading edge of the Tibetan plateau. I liked this description since I've personally driven to Denver from the eastern edge of Colorado a few times and can picture it well:\nThe location of Yibin mentioned here is close to the limit of upriver navigation even today. It is located at a fork in the river, where the Min (which flows down from Chengdu) and the Jinsha (considered the main branch of the upper Yangtze) come together. The remainder of Winchester's journey was mainly by road, following the river as much as possible. He actually drove all the way from Chengdu to Lhasa (and the infrastructure in this part of China was minimal in the 1990s) then went a bit north to see one of the sources of the Yangtze. This overland part of the book is also interesting, but I'm trying to focus on the river portion for this review (which is definitely long enough as it is!).\nThe upper watershed is some of the most rugged terrain on the planet:\n(In metric units, the slope above Yibin is 1.6 m/km). The vicinity of Lijiang sounds like a good place to see some of this rugged scenery. Winchester describes the rapids of Tiger Leaping Gorge and the first great bend in the river just to the west of Lijiang. Edward Gargan also spent some time in this area, so I'll have a bit more to say about it further on in this post.\nBefore moving on to the next book, the afterword of the second edition is worth discussing. It looks back at Shanghai's growth in the decade since he took this trip and wrote the book:\nHe felt that his prediction about Shanghai eclipsing Hong Kong was well underway by that point (2006). Another decade and a half later, and things have changed even more, as best I can tell from half a world away. Hong Kong is now not just feeling the pinch of competition from mainland port cities, but repression of its unique identity and political independence. At the same time, even Shanghai might now have reason to resent Beijing's domineering approach, for the way Covid was handled if nothing else.\nOn a semi-related note, I listened to a podcast interview earlier this year with Bo Shao, a Shanghaier who was one of the first Mainland Chinese students at Harvard, and later had a successful tech start-up. It really drove home how much Shanghai has transformed in only half a lifetime. And it contained a very thought-provoking quote about the legacy of the Cultural Revolution:  \"I would say this whole country has PTSD.\"\nEdward Gargan's travelogue begins near where Simon Winchester's ends, on the Tibetan plateau (although in the western Chinese province of Qinghai rather than in the Tibetan region itself). For The River's Tale, he travelled down the Mekong. As with travel along the Yangtze, the journey in the upper watershed had to be conducted by road (and these roads sounded pretty sketchy in the late-1990s (the journey was in 1998 and the book was published in 2002) from his telling).\nHere is how Gargan describes his route:\nEven this brief overview shows some of this differences in writing style and topical emphasis from the other book. Which one is more to one's taste surely depends greatly on personality. Gargan's sentences are longer and have more adjectives (at one point he uses the word eleemosynary); they convey broad impressions rather than the types of details Winchester captures about rock formations and rapids (let alone quantitative details, for the most part). The focal topics in The River's Tale are the cultures along the Mekong and the traumatic history of the second half of the 20th Century; The River at the Centre of the World had more about geography, economic trends, and a longer historical view (reaching back at least to the middle of the 19th Century pretty frequently), for comparison. The history that he covers is palpably personal to Gargan: not only did he have a lot of work experience as a journalist in that region, he also was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War and spent time in prison for it.\nAs mentioned, he began his journey on the Tibetan plateau, where the headwaters of the Mekong and many other mighty rivers originate (see the first figure in this post for an illustration of this):\nAfter starting from some villages and towns in Qinghai, one of the first cities he visits is Chamdo/Qamdo. It sits at a confluence of the Mekong and was a historic cross-roads for the tea trade, with East-West traffic between Lhasa and Sichuan along with a route south to Yunnan.\nIn Tibet, and regions of neighbouring provinces like Qinghai and Yunnan where Tibetan culture is prevalent, Gargan was able to witness first-hand the rubble of some monasteries and other signs of suppression against monks:\nIn fact, it's not a stretch to say that Communists oppressing Buddhists is a recurring motif in his travelogue.\nMost of his time in China was actually in Yunnan, which stretches along most of the border with Myanmar and all of the border with Laos. This certainly sounds like a beautiful area. Apparently the photos in National Geographic by Joseph Rock (a photographer and botanist mentioned in both books, as both authors travelled through Yunnan) were the inspiration for Shangri-la. This is also where rhododendrons grow natively. He also recommends a novel that is partially set in this general area of southwestern China: Soul Mountain by Gao Xingjian.\nThis region (i.e. Yunnan and western Sichuan) is home to a lot of Chinese ethnic minorities (such as the Yi, Wa, and Naxi/Nakhi peoples). While they can face a lot of challenges, Gargan was impressed with the efforts they had made to preserve their traditional culture. One example of this would be the preservation of traditional Naxi music, whose roots reach back to the Tang dynasty of over a millennium ago. In contrast, he felt (from years covering Asia as a foreign correspondent) that much of mainstream Chinese culture was not being preserved between the impact of the Cultural Revolution and a rush to modernize in more recent decades:\nIn contrast to the Yangtze, that the other book discussed in this post could title \"the river at the centre of the world\" without irony or hyperbole, the Mekong is much more marginal. At least in some aspects. It flows through remote parts of China, forms part of the border of Myanmar (a section of the border with China and the complete border with Laos), forms part of the border between Thailand and Laos in at least two sections, flows through parts of Laos and down the middle of Cambodia (and forms a short section of the border between them—at Si Phan Don which I'll have more to say about later), and finally has its delta in southern Vietnam. The delta aside, for most of its length, the banks of the Mekong have at least two of the following properties: separated by international borders, sparsely populated, or severely underdeveloped. This makes it well-suited for lawless activities like drug cultivation, and smuggling (including of weapons to resist the Japanese during the Second World War).  The remoteness and liminality of the Mekong riparian also means that so far it has been very lightly industrialized. This limits certain types of pollution, although lots of raw sewage enters the river in its second half (the terrain is too rugged to have many riverfront towns in China) and the author also observed lots of random litter and flotsam like styrofoam.\nLaos was a country where the author spent a fair bit of time on his trip. This was quite interesting, as it's not a place you hear much about. The impression that comes from The River's Tale is of a place that, even in the late 1990s, was basically left behind by the modern world. At the time (and possibly still although I haven't checked), it was the third largest producer of opium in the world (after Afghanistan and Myanmar), but something that stood out to me was that yields were significantly lower than in Myanmar/Burma (presumably due to less access to agricultural inputs and equipment). The contrast with Thailand was especially stark:\nUnlike the other Mekong countries, Thailand hadn't suffered under either colonialism or Communism, and it showed.\nIn Laos, Gargan spent time in the old royal capital of Luang Prabang, where he talked to students at Buddhist monasteries. They had rules for a simple and austere life (e.g. no eating after noon); they were also one of the only means for Laotian youth to get an education (and provided a generalized curriculum, not just studies in Buddhism). From there, he travelled to the capital of Vientiane; this journey had me shaking my head in several places. The water level was low but he insisted on travelling by boat, even when the boat captain or helmsman tried to pawn him off on other vessels or modes of transportation. He interpreted it as them not wanting to hold up their end of a deal that he'd already paid for, and to solve it the way you would any normal interpersonal conflict. For me, however, being more savvy about boats and rivers than the author (I've got an excerpt below that I think justifies this view), a much more likely explanation was that the river was dangerous to travel on at those water levels. If he wanted to risk it anyway, it would have been better to switch boats (or at least pilots) frequently so that the person steering would be familiar with the locations of submerged rocks and other hazards, but instead he tried to stick with one for this whole segment of the journey. And indeed there were at least a couple of hair-raising experiences with rapids along the way.\nThe next country on the Mekong after Laos is Cambodia. Before reaching it, there is a spectacular reach of the river where it runs along the border, known as Si Phan Don: Four Thousand Islands. It ends with a waterfall that is the largest in Asia by flow and the widest in the world before crossing the border into Cambodia. During the French colonial period, a portage railway (compare it to the never-completed Chignecto ship railway by Henry Ketchum and the marine railway on the Shubenacadie Canal) was built here, since the Mekong was otherwise navigable through most of French Indochina. Following the waterfall, the Mekong is only 117 ft above sea level where it enters Cambodia, so the river is generally gentler the rest of the way to the sea (an average slope of 0.07 m/km for those keeping track at home).\nLooking back at his journey so far, Gargan reflected:\nIn Cambodia, Communist rule had been even worse for the people, with the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot committing auto-genocide in the late 1970s. Although they had been out of power for two decades by the time the author visited (driven out by a Vietnamese invasion) they had persisted as an armed force in northern Cambodia, and Pol Pot himself only died the year before the journey in this book.\nApparently the Khmer Rouge were obsessed with mass labour, harkening back to the glory days of Angkor. The River's Tale mentioned some of the prominent accomplishments of this labour (which were also in Steven Mithen's Thirst):\nPol Pot's regime didn't get anything nearly so productive done. And the things they did do were heavy to read about.\nThe last country on the itinerary was Vietnam, specifically the Mekong Delta region in the south.\nGargan compares the Mekong Delta region to the Netherlands, in both size and population. It was one of the most pro-American parts of the country during the Vietnam war, and many people from there left as refugees after the South fell. Saigon/Ho Chi Min city is adjacent to the Delta, and he used it as a gateway to the region. From his description, it was probably the most bustling and upward-trending place he visited on his whole trip. From Saigon/HCM, he travelled on a hydrofoil boat to Can Tho, the largest town in the Delta, then hired a local boat to tour around the distributaries and canals.\nUnlike the other places he travelled, he didn't have to deal with police checkpoints in the Mekong Delta. Also, people seemed more connected with the outside world (e.g. having a cousin in New Jersey). In spite of the war a generation earlier, it seemed (from Gargan's impressions anyway) to be one of the least-scarred places along the Mekong:\nWhile he was touring around the Delta, one excerpt reinforced my perception (already stated above), that the author was not a technical chap when it came to boats. Fixing an engine is almost like magic—though very poetic!—the way he tells it:\nHaving reached the South China Sea brings us full circle as far as the books are concerned. Before wrapping this post up, I have a few final topics I wanted to cover to bring the story up to the present.\nFirst of all, we need to talk about dams. Both authors noted a few dams that they passed in their journeys, and of course Winchester got to see the massive Three Gorges Dam under construction. However, the number of dams in this region has exploded since the start of the 21st century (i.e. shortly after these trips were taken). Here is a graph I made of the number of major dams in China, by year of construction:\nThis is not all of the dams in the country, only those greater than 100 metres in height. Of the 122 that exceed this threshold, 89 have been built since 2000. Many of these are in Sichuan (22) or Yunnan (26); there are 10 dams each on the Jinsha (upper Yangtze) and Lancang (Chinese name for Mekong), and many other dams on other Yangtze tributaries.\nCurrently, there is a drought in the region, which is partially exacerbated by the dams, and also makes them less useful at generating power.\nThe Salween River flows through the same terrain in Western China as the Mekong and Yangtze. However it is much less dammed so far. Here is a nice short documentary about kayaking and rafting on it:\nI also found some videos of people whitewater kayaking on the Mekong in Laos and in Tibet (it doesn't say which rivers, but many of the ones there would be tributaries or the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Mekong).\nFinally, this idea of planning a trip around travelling along the entire length of a river, from source to mouth, is kind of inspiring, and something I'd like to do some day if possible (also see this post).\nPermalink",

    "content": "Wow, it's been 5 months or so since my last post. I'm still here—in fact, I have 10 or more posts at some level of draft but time to write has been in short supply—and I hope to publish a bit more in this second half of 2022. But we'll see how it goes. In the meantime, enjoy this latest links round-up.\nMy essay that I linked last time titled \"Deepfakes and digital resurrections\" continues to be relevant, with news coming out recently about an Alexa feature to mimic the voices of dead relatives.\nPretty early on in this blog's history, I had a post about a book by Michael J. Totten about Ukraine. Given current events there, he's revisited that book in an interesting article earlier this year; it really emphasizes how Ukraine is stuck on the boundary line between Western and Russian spheres of influence.\nOn a related topic, this article discusses the outlook for Eurasian economic integration (the geopolitics of this were also discussed in Dawn of Eurasia, a book I read last year):\nOne big issue the conflict in Ukraine has revealed is the vulnerability that comes from depending on hostile nations for energy needs. Check out this infographic and this report on that subject. Similarly, this article initiates badly-needed conversation on the strategic landscape for mineral resources that are vital for modern technology (it includes a graphic about the \"rocks in an iPhone) and infrastructure:\nAnother current event worth staying abreast of is the economic crisis in Sri Lanka (which is in a very strategically important location in the Indian Ocean, kind of on the boundary between Chinese and Indian spheres of influence). Here are a couple of explainers about the situation.\nCloser to home, some recent bills in the Canadian parliament affecting online streaming and news (C-11 and C-18) have a lot of people concerned. I also worry that they will diminish Canadians' access to diverse media sources at a time when domestic media is increasingly beholden to the government: mainstream journalists get subsidized to the tune of $600 million over 5 years via the Canadian Periodical Fund—along with $1.4 billion in annual public funding of the CBC.\nA couple of other links relevant to current events: rent control once again not working; a deep dive into Canadian labour shortages.\nHere's a two-part (so far?) short story inspired by Till We Have Faces to enjoy.\nHere are some useful reference links on machines/technology you can build yourself. On a similar note, here's some impressive machining of clock components and an investigation of the antikythera mechanism. And a history lesson about gears.\nContinuing on the theme of technology, this article about implementing neural networks on analog hardware is fascinating. In one example, vibrations encoding an input get mixed with an interference pattern and their combination (on a metal plate) yields a vibration pattern encoding the output; \"training\" involves tweaking the interference pattern. (Note: one of the upcoming posts I'm working on is also about machine learning; watch for it hopefully sometime this fall). The same magazine also has a good article about the Collatz conjecture—an example of a math problem that is easy to describe (\"Just pick a number, any number: If the number is even, cut it in half; if it’s odd, triple it and add 1. Take that new number and repeat the process, again and again.\" Will it always eventually reach 1?) but extremely challenging to definitively prove.  For another math link, here's a cool cellular automata (my links round-up post from last summer had a 1D cellular automata script that I made).\nThere is an on-going debate about whether technological progress has stalled. This author thinks that a return to rapid progress will require breakthroughs in new materials (e.g. nanotechnology) and/or new sources of energy, but his article is also valuable for giving an overview of various arguments on this topic.\nA very important tech-related topic that more people are becoming aware of is what I've heard referred to as the \"Age of Distraction\". Stewarding your attention is increasingly difficult but increasingly valuable. Here's some suggested reading/listening on this subject:\nIdentity is a contentious topic, but I found this take on it very thought-provoking and useful: that it's more about counter-party utility than self-actualization.\nI don't have a link about this, but something I've been thinking about in the aftermath of the pandemic is the psychology of masks. Covering the mouth inhibits communication, so people who already found it difficult (e.g. slightly hard of hearing, or especially dependent on body language; personally, I've always preferred video chats to phone calls because you really do lose a lot of bandwidth when you can't see the other person's face) can be pushed past the point where it is worth it. On the other hand, masquerade balls (where mainly the upper part of the face is covered) in the Renaissance or at Mardi Gras seem to lower social inhibitions. It would be interesting to see some proper experiments done comparing upper-face versus lower-face coverings.\nI listened to an interesting podcast with the authors of a book about ownership. They say that there are 6 \"stories\" people tell to justify ownership. Here is their framework:\nTo these, I assume can be added transfer (via an arbitrarily-long chain, as long as it's documented all the way) from someone who had ownership on one or more of these bases originally and thus had the right to sell. Where it gets interesting according to them is when some of these stories conflict (e.g. for genetic data you can argue self-ownership but someone else can argue labour to collect and analyze a sample)\nApproaching the end of this post, I have some miscellaneous links about interesting places etc. that I'll share just in point form:\nHere's a song with a similar vibe to listen to while you read this essay.\nFinally, I wanted to share a picture and description of a recent DIY project that wasn't enough to comprise a full post on its own. This is a tripod lamp that I built. It consists of an antique tripod (found at Henry's Vintage in Sarnia, Ontario), an assembly constructed of black ABS plumbing fittings (a reducer, a bushing, and a cap if I recall correctly), some lamp hardware, an Edison bulb (tubular shape), a protective cage, and chains and eyebolts on the legs to keep them from spreading. The ABS assembly attaches to the threaded mount on top of the tripod and has a couple of holes drilled in it for the cord and the threaded nipple stem for the lamp hardware.\nPermalink",

    "description": "New Brunswick would appear to be in a very reasonable neighbourhood when it comes to several healthcare metrics (per capita): spending, acute care beds, hospitals, and physicians. So why does the system feel so strained?",
    "content": "My latest annual overview of the New Brunswick provincial budget. This one includes a look at the fundamentals underlying its biggest component: healthcare.\nAs per usual, I'll try to keep most of the amounts in millions (M) of dollars (CAD) because I think it's easier to compare than mixing million and billions. And while I'll mostly refer to it as the 2022 budget, it is technically for the 2022-2023 fiscal year. As per usual, I'll try to focus on the facts and figures rather than opinion/commentary.\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nThe net debt by the end of the fiscal year will represent around 30% of provincial GDP (assuming the economy stays relatively stable). It is also almost back to the point it was when I started writing these posts in 2015 (i.e. $12600M).\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nThere was a 5.5% increase in the funding for the department of health and an 11.4% increase in the funding for the department of education and early childhood development over what was budgeted last year (these increases are approximately the same absolute value, and the different percentages reflect the different starting sizes of these departments). The department of social development had a 7.5% increase; the largest increase (and largest sector of that department overall) was to seniors and long term care, now at $860M. The department of tourism and heritage had an 11.3% increase. Finally, the general government category had a 13.3% increase; major expenses in this category include pensions and benefits for MLAs, judges, and government employees ($430M all together), the operations of Service New Brunswick ($194M), and a supplementary fund for responding to the settlement of collective bargaining agreements and unanticipated events.\nHere are a couple of graphs: a pie chart of spending by department, and a comparison (on a log scale, since departments have sizes that vary over a couple orders of magnitude) of the budgeted and actual spending from last year and the budget for the fiscal year to come.\nBefore moving on to the details of provincial revenue, I'll note (setting up the discussion below) that spending on healthcare is greater than any source of revenue: income taxes (personal + corporate) are $2441M, all other taxes are $2998M, and equalization payments are $2360M. In 2015 when I started doing these budget review posts, spending on healthcare was 2617M. It has gone up almost 25% in the intervening years, an average of 2.8% per year. This is above inflation, which totalled 17% over the same period. However, healthcare has actually fallen slightly as a proportion of the total budget from 30.3% to 28.9%. This illustrates the difficulty in any drastic increases to healthcare funding. Since it is already the largest department by far, increasing its share of the pie would require significant cuts elsewhere or major new sources of revenue.\nOn the revenue side of the 2022 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nLast year, the revenue from taxes in NB came in $690M higher than budgeted. I guess the government was anticipating the economy to struggle more than it did with the second year of the pandemic. Where there are changes in the forecasted revenue for this year, they generally assume it will be closer to how last year turned out than to what last year's budget anticipated.\nThe biggest tax-related change to note is that the double property tax on apartment buildings (relative to owner-occupied residences) will be phased out to bring them in line with other residential properties. In exchange for the reduced costs incurred by landlords (in the short term anyway, until assessment values reach a new equilibrium), a one-year cap (to 3.8%) on rent increases has been imposed. See this article and the government press release for more.\nHere is a graph of revenue by source comparing the budget for the current year with the budget and actual revenue from the fiscal year just ended:\nIn this section, I'll explore the fundamentals that our healthcare system has to deal with, which are heavily related to demographic trends. Two words tell much of the story: aging population. Elderly people have a much higher need for medical care; furthermore, as the working age population shrinks in proportion to retirees, there is a relatively smaller tax base to pay for government services like healthcare and also a smaller pool of potential employees to recruit from (within our borders anyway) to work in that sector. I'll also look at comparative data to other provinces and countries, and temporal trends in terms of staffing.\nTo start with, I found the table here to be incredibly informative. It allows you to compare a Canadian province to several OECD peer countries on a number of health-related metrics (the data is from 2018, so should still be pretty current).  I encourage everyone to click through and read the whole thing, but here are some things that stood out to me:\nLooking at the number of hospital establishments per capita (source here), New Brunswick is also ahead of the Canadian average: 5.3 per 100,000 people vs 3.3. However, Newfoundland, Manitoba, PEI, and Saskatchewan all have more (and I think the territories do as well, although I didn't calculate the per capita rate for them). This makes sense as rural, spread out populations need a larger number of smaller hospitals to provide geographic coverage. Still, it's well worth noting the way that more urbanized provinces can benefit from economies of scale here.\nI made the following graph of physicians per capita from the data here (up to 2015, with supplemental more recent data points for Canada and NB). The number of physicians per capita in NB has increased by 85% over the past 3 decades.\nBringing this all together, New Brunswick would appear to be in a very reasonable neighbourhood (considering the rest of Canada and peer countries) when it comes to several healthcare metrics: spending per capita, acute care beds per capita, hospitals per capita, and physicians per capita. So why does it feel like the system is so strained?\nStatistics Canada has an interactive feature where you can explore the shape of the population pyramid (the number of men and women at each age) for different provinces or the country as a whole. It is based on census data until 2016 and then demographers' projections after that (I used the medium growth scenario). Here is the population pyramid for 2022. Note the bulge of Baby Boomers who recently became seniors or will before the decade is out:\nUsing this tool, I plotted the proportion of seniors (averaged between men and women) for selected years in the past and the future. The Statistics Canada forecasts only go to 2036, but this proportion is still increasing by then in the extrapolation (In Factfulness, Hans Rosling pointed out that the aging of people already born is much easier to extrapolate than a lot of other trends). This proportion is around 3 times higher than it was when Medicare was introduced; in these projections it looks like it will increase almost as much in the next 10-15 years as it did in the previous. Which is likely to increase demand on the healthcare system faster than any plausible increases in funding can keep up with.\nI also tried making my own basic demographic model (see the script at the bottom of this post), starting from the 2022 conditions in the medium growth scenario from Statistics Canada. I assumed 6200 or 8000 annual births and 7100 or 12800 annual net migrants (combined for migration within Canada and international migration, with an assumed average age of 40). Under these various scenarios, the average age in my model increased by 1.6 to 3.0 years over the next two decades. So looking at it a couple of different ways, an aging population is something we can expect to face for the foreseeable future. Eventually it should stabilize, but until it does, my expectation is that the strain on the healthcare system will continue to increase for the reasons outlined above (i.e. increased demand paired with relatively smaller working age tax base and recruitment pool).\nAn important caveat to this discussion of demographics is that New Brunswick has out-performed the projections on population growth since the last census—I'll be waiting to see when Statistics Canada can update their population pyramids with the latest data. Even the \"high-growth scenario\" had predicted a population of 775,000 by 2022, while in reality we've reached 797,000. I doubt it's been enough to halt the aging population trend, but probably does mitigate it at least somewhat.\nThis section is just my brainstorming; I'm not a health policy expert by any means. In general, they revolve around ways to improve efficiency or divert some medical care (especially routine and low-risk stuff) away from the most bottlenecked parts of the system:\nLinks:\nHere is the code for the simplified demographic model I mentioned above:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This didn't take too long to build, but it was fun and unique.\nTensegrity is a structural technique that relies on elements under tension for its integrity (hence the name). Tensegrity structures also have elements under compression, but their discontinuous arrangement gives a gravity-defying appearance to the whole. After seeing some examples going around of projects using this technique, I decided to give it a try myself.\nThe design I came up with was for a footstool (which could also be used as a small table for beverages in front of a couch). It comprises two wooden frames held together with a couple of chain links and some cord. There is a clear sheet of plexiglass for the top surface to make the structure as visible as possible. Here is a photo, which shows the way the upper frame appears to float:\nThe two frames use oak 1x2s for the flat part and poplar 2x2s for the columns and lintels; the flat part is sized to be a 1-ft square—on the inside dimensions for the base and the outside dimensions for the top.  The column and lintel assemblies for the two frames had to be completed with the top and bottom stacked together (see photo below on the lower left) since they need to encompass each other. Eye hooks were installed at the corners of the flat part of each frame along with eye bolts in the centre of each lintel. The final step in the structural construction (adding the plexiglass top surface came later as a finishing step) was to add the elements under tension: the chain links at the heart of the footstool and the cords connecting corresponding corners on the top and bottom frames. The cords pass through tensioning ratchets (the kind intended for clotheslines) so they can be kept taut enough to provide stability. The following photos show various stages of the construction as it progressed:\nAny tensegrity design like this needs to have a portion of the upper piece extend below part of the lower piece so that a tension element can impart an upward force to the upper piece. In this case, the central chain performs this function. Not only does it need to counteract the weight of the upper frame plus anything placed on top of it, it also needs to counteract the tension in the cords on the side, which all act to pull the two frame pieces together in order to provide stability. So the central tension element (the chain links, which are rated for 400 lbs.) hold the top piece up, and the other tension elements (the cord has a working capacity of 110 lbs., but the eye hooks are the limiting factor with a rating of 60 lbs., so the cord can only have about 30 lbs. of tension on it since each hook is pulled on by two segments of the cord (a more detailed analysis would account for the two segments of cord not pulling in quite the same direction)) provide stability. To wrap up the discussion of how forces are transmitted through the structure, the columns each carry (assuming even distribution) half the load in compression that the central chain does in tension.\nFinally, here's a link that uses tensegrity as a mental model for geopolitics.  To tie this whole post together, applying these concepts to Ottomans (either kind) is left as an exercise to the reader.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Last year was a busy year on the personal front (due to a growing family) so I didn't have as much time to write reviews of things I read compared to previous years. Still, I wanted to have some highlights and notes to reference in future posts; the collection below (which also covers a few shows) might also catch my readers' interest to check out some of these works.\nEach book or show has a separate section below. This overall post is lengthy, but most of the sections are fairly succinct and can stand alone. Although there are some overlapping commonalities between many of them, such as including settings in Central Asia or dealing with empires in flux.\nDawn of Eurasia by Bruno Maçães was published in 2018 but if anything is even more timely now. He travelled overland from the Caucasus Mountains to the Sea of Japan and combined that with his experience in politics (he was a government minister in Portugal whose responsibilities involved acting as a liaison with the EU) and knowledge of literature to paint a picture of the strategic outlook of Eurasia. His thesis is that it will be increasingly difficult to treat Europe and Asia as separate continents (the line between them has always been blurry, of course) as infrastructure and political/economic links between them increase; what happens in the region connecting the most heavily-populated parts of Europe and Asia will impact the whole world. While reading it, I frequently thought of Monsoon by Robert Kaplan which I reviewed around a year ago: it covers the strategic outlook of the regions along the southern coast of Asia, while Dawn of Eurasia looks to the centre of the continent.\nIt isn't written as a straight travelogue, but he visited numerous places while researching it, including: Istanbul, Transnistria, Baku, Astrakhan, Turkmenbashi, Khorgas, Yiwu, Vladiovstok, and more.\nSince I read this book in the first half of 2021, here are some of the developments in the region that amply demonstrate its importance for global stability:\nReading Bruno Maçães' book helped give me a broader context for events like these. Aside from a continuous gradient from Brussels to Beijing in place of a clear division between the continents, he is also expecting a much more multi-polar world in the near future: instead of an international order where Washington largely calls the shots, we may see competing zones of influence—especially in Eurasia. I also really appreciated the cultural context the book provided by referencing some literature from the region.\nHere are some excerpts from Dawn of Eurasia that I found thought-provoking:\nThis excerpt points out that infrastructure connecting China to places to the west by land has to go through the province of Xinjiang, which the book points out borders 7 or 8 countries. But it is also a place where China is using heavy-handed measures to maintain control, which isn't so conducive to trade. I was also reflecting while reading Dawn of Eurasia that the whole Belt and Road Initiative (一带一路) seems to have an \"if you build it, they will come\" mindset. The ports discussed in Monsoon don't really seem to be taking off though. While the Chinese government seems quite successful at developing infrastructure, when it comes to institutional environments that promote trade and innovation they have less of a track record (consider how Hong Kong is losing a lot of what made it special, for example).\nThis quote is one that Maçães shares to give a Russian perspective on the EU. The way he describes it is that the EU tries to make rules (on trade etc.) that function like an automaton. They see this as an objective approach, stemming from a belief in convergence (that as countries develop they will end up adopting the same governance structures and institutions); a common Russian perspective, in contrast, puts a lot more weight on who gets the power to make the rules.\nChina, Russia, and the EU get the most attention in Dawn of Eurasia, but it doesn't neglect other players. Aside from the ones mentioned in this excerpt, it has a good discussion of Turkey's strategic compass: will they identify most with the Turkic world (East), the Islamic world (South), continue pursuing EU membership (West), or realize they have a lot of interests (e.g. oil & gas pipelines heading west from the Caspian) in common with their traditional rival Russia (North)?\nOne of the strengths of Dawn of Eurasia is its coverage of Russia. Bruno Maçães is conversant in Russian literature (I might want to read a novel he mentioned, Day of the Oprichnik, at some point) and political thought. Russia is the most natively Eurasian country, spanning the continents not only geographically, but in terms of its roots, its influences, and its outlook. They are pulled in opposite directions exemplified by the historical influence of the Mongols (to which they can be considered as much of a successor state as anyone), and the westward-looking legacy of Peter the Great.\nThe Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire by Jack Weatherford (I've also read Indian Givers by him) covers the history of the Mongolian empire, with a focus on the women who had a role in its leadership at various times. It conveys a lot about the Mongol culture and history in general, in addition to its main topic of the queens and princesses.\nIn the first generation after Genghis Khan, his daughters' marriages sealed some important alliances, but their involvement and contribution to expanding and running the empire extended beyond that. In Mongolian society, women were the ones to own the ger/yurt and the cart used to transport it, while the men had ownership of the livestock. Genghis Khan extended this division of responsibility to the roles in government he envisioned for his daughters and sons-in-law, as Weatherford relates from an account of the wedding of one of Genghis Khan's daughters:\nFor this reason, the sons-in-law (guregen) had short life expectancies, although their clans gained a lot of prestige from the union. Over a century later, Tamerlane used Guregen as a title to emphasize his link by marriage to the Borjigin clan of Genghis Khan.\nSome of the notable historical figures that Weatherford spends some time on in his book include Alaqai (one of the daughters of Genghis Khan), Khutulun (a great-great-granddaughter), and Manduhai (a queen of the Mongols by marriage, almost 300 years after the birth of the empire).\nAlaqai led by example in importing reading and writing to the Mongol Empire, seeing its importance for administration. Their empire was very diverse at this time—the book notes the presence of religious structures associated with at least three religions in the ruins of Olon Sume—but copying a system of government instead of rolling their own would lead to a loss of identity:\nManduhai probably gets the most attention in the book. Before her time, the Mongolian empire was in decline. The Yuan dynasty had forgotten a lot of their nomadic skills for living on the steppe by the time they returned to Mongolia as refugees following their loss of control over China in 1368.\nShe became a queen in 1464. After her first husband died, she betrothed herself to another heir of Genghis Khan (it was normal in Mongol culture for the new khan to inherit wives from the previous one) and reigned as his regent until he came of age.\nI don't remember exactly where this ended up being in her case, but some areas that the Mongols asserted control over at various times included the Gansu Corridor, where Silk Road traffic was funnelled between the relatively impassable terrain of the Tibetan Plateau and Gobi Desert, and the Ordos Loop, an area (around present-day Ordos City) enclosed on three sides by the Yellow River swinging north and making its closest approach to Mongolia.\nI had read the first novel in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy over a decade ago, but didn't continue to the other books at that time. However, there was a scene from it that had stuck in my memory where someone from the Foundation visits a planet (Anacreon) and is shocked that they have reverted from nuclear energy to burning coal, seeing that as a clear marker of decline in technological capacity.  This felt like a timely notion (as seen in various recent news stories, although movement in the opposite direction also exists), so I decided to pick up where I had left off and read books 2 and 3 in the original Foundation trilogy.\nThe Foundation novels are more like sets of novellas; the same characters are not followed all the way through each book, but only for a section. This makes the character development relatively minimal, and even the plot sometimes feels more like an outline—the grand narrative arc of the series comes from stringing the developments in each novella together. The style certainly fits the themes of the series (which relate to the grand sweep of history) but I don't find it makes for especially exciting reading. The greatest strength of the Foundation trilogy is probably its world-building and the philosophical questions it raises. Much of that comes from the first novel, so that's the one I'm most likely to recommend or re-read in the future.\nAs an example of those strengths, here is an excerpt from chapter 6 of the first book. This is psychohistorian Hari Seldon defending himself against charges of treason for undermining the Galactic Empire (I've only included his remarks, not the lawyer's questions):\n(He goes on to introduce his plan to shorten the post-Imperial dark ages by preserving knowledge. Crucially, this needs to be done not in a lifeless archive but in a community--the Foundation--since technological know-how is too vast for any one person to master and too fragmentary to be useful unless it's embedded in a social fabric).\nOne other aspect that caught my attention while reading the latter novels in the original trilogy was some of the anachronistic details: their spaceships have pneumatic message tubes and most of the men have a smoking habit (but are mildly scandalized when a woman does).\nMy wife and I watched a Chinese show on Netflix last year called The Rise of Phoenixes. It's a Chinese historical drama (in a fictional dynasty, but the technology level seems roughly Ming-era) with tonnes of palace intrigue and the occasional ambush or battle. The plot is driven by five or six princes who are contending to be the designated crown prince and succeed their aging father as emperor; a young lady from a family with a lot of secrets also gets swept up in their ambition and conflict. It's a 70 episode marathon that kept us speculating on what would happen next up to the last episode. We watched it in Mandarin (subs ≫ dubs) and by the end of it had even absorbed a few phrases through sheer repetition (e.g. Bìxià (陛下) = your majesty) and gleaned some cultural insights.\nI've discussed Dune the book before:\nBasically, with mankind forbidden from making \"a machine in the likeness of a human mind\", they made some human minds more machine-like with the consumption of prodigious amounts of Spice.\n2021 brought Dune the movie. In contrast to the book, it didn't focus nearly as much on how irreplaceable Spice is for galactic transportation; nor was the parallel theme on how tight of a constraint water scarcity places on life on Arrakis given much attention (although there was an effective scene with someone watering palm trees). However, I'd guess both of these themes will feature more prominently in Part 2 now that some of the other world-building has been established.\nThe movie definitely succeeded in making the planet with its hostile environment feel like a palpable force instead of a mere setting. This article discusses the set design. There were a lot of little details I liked—as in Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villenueve has filmed an intricate world where you get the sense a lot has happened, while direct exposition is kept relatively light. The way shields were colour-coded differently for a block and a successful hit was demonstrated in a training session; this made later combat scenes easier to follow. The palace on Arrakis had bas-relief panels in several rooms that made me wish I could pause and zoom in (I think they may have been of different stages in the sandworms' life-cycle). And the ornithopters looked really cool. In my opinion, it should be a strong contender for some academy awards in cinematography and production design (and perhaps other categories too).\nLupin is a short (10 episodes so far, although apparently it was renewed for a third season) French mystery show that we watched on Netflix. It reminded me in several ways of BBC's Sherlock with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman: it adapts a popular series of stories from the 19th or early 20th century into a modern setting, complete with the use of some of the latest technology; the protagonist is very clever and the acting is good. There are enough differences to make it creative and unique, though. For one, the Lupin books exist in the show and the main character is inspired by them (and finds allies through a shared interest in the books), rather than being Lupin. And unlike Sherlock Holmes, Lupin (or Assane Diop, played by Omar Sy, in the present-day setting of the show) is a «gentleman burglar» instead of working on the same side as the police. His motivating goal is to clear his late father's name of a crime he was unjustly accused of. At the same time, he's trying not to lose having a relationship with his own teenage son. In parallel with his schemes as an adult, the show features frequent flashbacks to Diop's days as a schoolboy, where he developed the skills and relationships that he draws on as the plot unfolds.\nA long-standing personal goal of mine has been to read a novel in French. Last year I accomplished that, with Michel Houellebecq's Extension du domaine de la lutte (there is an English translation under the title of Whatever). He's one of the most prominent contemporary French novelists. It was written back in the 1990s, but I didn't realize that at first (because I hadn't bothered to check the copyright page), but some little details as I was reading made me go back and check. These included the currency being Francs rather than Euros along with some aspects of the technology in use, which comes up frequently since the main character works in IT. In spite of being written over 2 decades ago, the way it addresses atomization and alienation in the digital age makes it seem like the author either anticipated some trends or such trends were underway earlier in France. For example, a discussion about the possibility to eventually \"établir un système de transactions généralisées recouvrant l'ensemble des activités sociales\" seems to anticipate social networking sites (or perhaps even China's social credit system).\nThe book is divided into three parts, which I would summarize (trying to avoid too many spoilers) as follows:\nHere are some passages that stood out to me. The first is complaining that modern life gives people a lot more freedom/options, but less human connection:\nThe next passage puts some of the blame on his own profession, expressing that more information is the last thing the world needs:\nThis passage is one that includes the title (emphasis added) and expresses that liberal attitudes toward sexuality produce winners and losers the same way free markets do in the economic sphere:\nWhile I was reading this novel, I came across (possibly in another review I checked out, I can't remember exactly where I saw it) a quote from Francis Fukuyama that seems to fit some of its themes. (Note that «lutte» in the title of Houellebecq's book can be translated \"struggle\", and the 1990s when it was written was a time when external struggle looked like it might be in the past with the ending of the Cold War):\nLooking around the internet at other reviews (like this one) of Houellebecq's novels, I get the impression that the one I read (which was his first published) contains a lot of the themes that he returns to over and over (perhaps drawing from personal experience), such as alienation, the collateral damage of modern relationship norms, depression, etc. If I read another one—I'd certainly like to read another novel in French at some point, but might pick a cheerier one—Serotonine (dealing with declining rural communities) sounds the most interesting.\nThe Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel by Milorad Pavic is a novel with a very experimental structure. It is written in the form of three dictionaries (from Christian, Islamic, and Jewish perspectives) with entries about the Khazar people, their religious conversion, and biographies of scholars who'd studied them. The story had less to do with the historical Khazars (I think it's fair to say that it is more about the Balkans) than I was hoping from the title, and was, frankly, quite weird, with many elements having a Kabbalah-flavoured mysticism.\nIn my opinion,  it was far more interesting and memorable for the structure than the plot and characters.  The main thread of the plot takes place largely in the Balkans and Constantinople centuries after the era of the Khazars and involves scholars researching the \"Khazar polemic\" (which seems to partly draw on the conversion of Vladimir the Great as well as fragments known about the Khazars) in the 17th and 20th centuries. These researchers end up linked together through dreams and the Dictionary they are trying to compile or recover.\nWhile the experimental aspects of the structure are interesting, I found it was trying to do too much. There were three fairly unique aspects to this novel: having male and female editions that differ slightly—but not making a material difference to the outcome as far as I can tell; parallel dictionaries recounting the same event from different perspectives; and characters being connected across space or time via dreams. Any one of them would have been experimental enough and probably could have been developed more on its own instead of trying to fit them all into a single book. The connections between different characters I feel has been done better in other books I've read such as The Years of Rice and Salt and This is How You Lose the Time War. However, structuring it as not only a single dictionary, but multiple ones from different perspectives was truly unique.\nBecause of the structure, you don't have to read it straight through cover-to-cover. My recommendation for anyone who wants to check this book out would be one of two approaches, depending on the facets that interest you more (and to minimize the feeling that the author is trying to pack in too many experimental aspects):\nTrack 2 (i.e. the scholars and the way their lives are woven together across time and space) is the main thread of the plot, but as noted the plot isn't the most interesting thing about this book. In either track, flip to cross-referenced entries iff they seem necessary to understand the context of something you're reading.\nTo give a sense of the flavour of this novel, here are a couple of excerpts from the entry on Yusuf Masudi. The first concerns his efforts as a \"dream hunter\", trying to track down dreams across multiple people:\nThe second relates to his efforts to collect manuscripts related to the Khazar question and assemble a dictionary; it makes him wonder about different perspectives on the same historical events:\nPermalink",

My review of one of them, Lotharingia, was one of my favourite posts of the year. There are other books I read that I intend to feature in some posts early in the new year.\nThe internet appears like it could become more of a conflict zone (featuring threats from censorship to doxxing and ransomware to psyops). Taking more control over your own online activities is one reasonable reaction to this. The second post I wanted to highlight in this annual round-up is a guide I wrote for doing so (to teach myself as much as anyone). To continue to apply some of what I learned, I put an archive for this year (not including this post or the collections of links, only original content; note that not all the formatting carried over to the .pdf I made, so you can no longer easily identify blockquotes) as an IPFS link, as described in that post. If your browser isn't set up to support IPFS, replace the ipfs:// in the URL with https://ipfs.io/ipfs/.\nA third post from the past year that stands out is one that my wife helped edit where we shared some tips on putting on an affordable wedding celebration.\nHere is the full list of the posts from this year:\nTo go back further in the archives, check out previous year-end posts:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Economic concepts in computer games is a subject I've previously written about. This time, I'll look at trade of commodities in a game that I think implements it well.\nPatrician IV is a game set in the historic Hanseatic League, a late medieval trading network centered in northern Germany and extending throughout the Baltic and a fair bit of the North Sea. The game features well over a dozen goods that can be bought and sold in towns across the region. Their prices vary depending on their availability in each market and when the player buys or sells a quantity of goods, the average unit price is rarely the same as the spot price before the transaction, since the availability is dynamically altered during the transaction, reflecting market depth. Next to each good in the market there are up to four diamonds, reflecting its abundance/availability. Buying up something that is already scarce or in high demand (1 diamond or less) will lower your popularity in that town, but selling something scarce will increase your popularity (and earn a nice profit in the process). This video explains more about the trading system in Patrician IV.\nContango is \"a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price\". If I understand correctly, it should be understood as a comparison with the expected spot price at maturity rather than the current spot price. As futures contracts come due, the futures price and the spot price have to converge. However, in the title of this post, I'm using the term in a less technical and more colloquial sense. After all, the game is set before the first stock market (1611), let alone the development of futures contracts. The core idea, though, is of an opportunity for arbitrage—taking advantage of differences in prices (again, applying a less technical definition to markets 650 years ago)—that is temporal rather than spatial.\nA real world example was the time that oil prices briefly went negative in April 2020 (which feels very distant from the current conditions, where the price of oil hit a five+ year high last month). The reason that happened is that futures contracts were coming up to the delivery date but demand had cratered and storage capacity was largely used up; the oil had to be delivered but there were so few takers that anyone who could free up some storage or transportation space for it was getting paid rather than having to buy to receive it. If you had storage space near Cushing, Oklahoma (the contractual location for West Texas Intermediate oil), you could have made a tidy contango play. This example illustrates the link between carrying/storage capacity and contango.\nWith that introduction behind us, I'll retell the events of a playthrough I did earlier this year, pointing out where and how these things apply. The first order of business was to choose a hometown. I chose Visby since it is relatively central and can serve as a sort of gateway or entrepôt for the eastern Baltic. In the game (as in reality), not all products are harvested or manufactured in every location. The towns of the eastern Baltic are the only source of pelts. Many of them are also good sources of hemp (for making rope), wood, and bricks, although these items can be found more widely. Conversely, several key goods are not produced in this region, including cheese (except in my home port of Visby), cloth, grain, and beer. Having scoped out the landscape of supply and demand, I focused my initial trading efforts on collecting pelts from this region then making longer runs to the UK (mainly Edinburgh) for cloth and using Visby as the exchange point. I also took a lot of cheese from Visby to ports further east where it wasn't readily available. Finally, there were some intra-regional trade opportunities based on demand for inputs to certain production chains: Novgorod has salt and Stockholm produces salted fish; Visby and Riga have honey while Novgorod and Stockholm produce mead.\nThe game begins in April of 1370. By the end of that year, my initial trade runs (in which I manually told my ship where to go and what to buy and sell) had brought in enough income that I was able to expand my business to 3 ships and several properties in my hometown: a warehouse, a few houses (rental income), and two hemp farms. With storage space in my warehouse and an administrator on staff in my counting house, I no longer had to manually trade in Visby. Instead, I could set rules to buy or sell up to a certain quantity of various goods whenever the price went past a given point. The next two screenshots show these rules. For example, I'll sell cheese from my warehouse (maintaining a reserve of 50 units for loading on ships to trade to other ports) when the price rises above 155 and buy cheese (up to 200 units) when the price falls below 123. The goods to buy are only those that are produced in Visby, while the goods to sell includes most of the commodities available in the game. I set these rules by looking at the normally prevailing prices in the local market (i.e. with locally-produced goods abundantly available and imported goods in high demand due to scarcity). This way, when my ships returned from trading voyages, I could unload the goods to my own warehouse and sell them when the market conditions were favourable, instead of being at the mercy of whatever the market price was at the conclusion of a voyage. Prices change when other merchants make large purchases or sales (among other factors), so having a higher sell price for the same goods I have rules to buy allows for taking some quick profit—with no added work or risk—on occasions when someone else drives the price up.\nOccasionally, a really good opportunity arises. In the following screenshot, a large quantity of beer suddenly became available in Visby. I bought as much of it into my warehouse as I could without driving the price point above my automated sell point. I knew that once the glut passed, I could sell it for the normally-prevailing price—an example of contango. This was possible because I had enough space in my warehouse (you can rent space in other merchants' warehouses if you exceed your capacity, but the rental fees will eat into this kind of profit; you can also invest capital in more warehouses, but should consider the opportunity cost of doing that versus making other investments like rental properties or production facilities).\nBy the spring of 1371, I was ready to automate one of my regular trade routes. Similar to the settings shown above for a counting house in my home port, the game allows you to set rules for prices and quantities of goods to load or unload at a sequence of ports. I set up a circuit from Visby - Stockholm - Riga - Reval - Novgorod and then repeating. It traded the same goods I had already been dealing with on the voyages I controlled directly (e.g. cheese and honey from Visby, mead and fish from Stockholm, salt and pelts from Novgorod). The screenshot below shows the sell settings for Stockholm. Note that even though I'm buying fish and mead there, I also have rules to sell them at a much higher price should the opportunity arise.\nAlso in the Spring of 1371, I lost 3 ships from 2 convoys to pirates. I'd judged incorrectly that I'd be able to defeat them instead of trying to evade or outrun them. Still, my trade routes and business operations in Visby were profitable enough that I was able to recover, and by mid-October of that year, was back up to 4 ships. By this time, I'd also set up another automated trade route, to Edinburgh. As your character gains ships, wealth, and businesses, you rise in rank as a merchant. This unlocks new privileges and can eventually give you the opportunity to participate in Guild and town politics. The next step for my character at this point was to expand to another town. I selected Thorn for a combination of reasons: I already had some popularity there (and no other Guild merchant was more popular) and it is a source of in-demand goods such as grain (not otherwise available in the eastern Baltic), pitch (needed to build ships), and lumber (needed for building ships and businesses, so strategic for further expansion). It is located up a river, so only shallow-draft boats can get there, but that just serves to limit competition.\nBy the end of April in 1372, I'd reached the rank of Grand Merchant. And had finally defeated a pirate fleet for the first time. That was about as far as I played on this play-through. My next expansion plans were to expand to Novgorod and then Copenhagen. The former would allow me to collect pelts in a warehouse or even produce them in my own businesses, so I could get a favourable price for a key trade good my convoys were bringing from the east. The latter would serve as a western hub the way Visby had on the eastern half of the map. Eventually, I'd aim to implement a hub-and-spokes trading network of automated convoys in the west, with other automated convoys circulating goods produced in my own businesses between the ports where I had a presence. Beyond that, an established merchant can get married and start a family, and even run for office. My Patrician IV strategy always includes keeping one fleet that I control manually so I can perform missions, take advantage of abnormal supply/demand conditions (in-game events sometimes result in a supply glut or demand spike of a trade good in a town somewhere), and fight pirates. There's also a sketchy guy in some taverns that tries to persuade you to partner with him in plausibly-deniable acts of piracy, but I try to resist that temptation.\nA setting I think would make a great sequel or mod to this game is the Indian Ocean in the ~18th century. Aside from a different map, the trade goods would differ (e.g. spices, tea, ivory, gold, etc.). Other possible features could be reputation scores with various imperial navies (Portuguese, British, Dutch, Ottoman, Mughal, Maratha, etc.) and local rulers that would protect you or attack you if it got far enough from neutral; additionally, the effect of the monsoon winds could be simulated by having travel be much faster/easier in the appropriate directions depending on the season.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is a short post to check in on an issue I wrote about a year and a half ago.\nIn my review of the New Brunswick provincial budget in 2020, I discussed Equalization payments and linked to a manifesto against them that some Albertans had made:\n... \"These changes would acknowledge that programs like the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer already provide equitable stable funding for provincial social programs, would ensure all regions are treated equally, and would serve to remove disincentives for provinces to improve their fiscal situations.\"\nThis excerpt is from a manifesto that is unlikely to be implemented as-is (at least in my opinion). But the sentiment behind it is likely to be part of the national conversation in the years ahead. An adjustment to the Equalization formula may thus become a political necessity for the federal government; any adjustment is unlikely to benefit New Brunswick so being in a flexible fiscal position to deal with diminished revenue from this source would be prudent.\nWell, now the province of Alberta has had a referendum on the matter of Equalization payments (where the \"Yes\" side was in support of changing the constitution to remove the commitment to inter-provincial fiscal equalization). Official results will be released next week, but the current indications point to it passing. As the linked article says, Alberta can't unilaterally change the Canadian constitution, but the Albertan premier expects that the referendum result will give his province more \"leverage\" in negotiations with the Federal government. So my prediction that anti-Equalization sentiment would become a part of the national conversation is looking pretty accurate.\nThis post gives a perspective from Alberta on the political calculations (i.e. that the squeaky wheel gets the grease), and also says that, \"federal transfers of gobs of cash is increasingly the only tenuous thread holding the nation together\".\nWhat does this mean for New Brunswick? For the moment, there won't be any changes. In the medium term, having Equalization as a contentious topic that is straining Canadian federalism could put the finances of \"have not\" provinces under a lot more scrutiny. And even a small possibility of losing these payments is a sword of Damocles. NB received $2.3 billion this year from Equalization (over 20% of the budget). By comparison, we're spending $3.1 billion on health care; no other department had spending over $1.5 billion. So any cuts would be very painful if this source of revenue was curtailed (and not making cuts would put us on a fast track to default).\nTo investigate the impact of Equalization payments, I compared the relative size of the public sector between provinces:\nThe Equalization data came from here and the data on employment by sector from here. Alberta, BC, and Ontario cluster around having 19.6% of their workforce in the public sector. The \"Canada total\" datapoint is just the average Equalization payments per capita for all provinces; the per capita average for the whole country is $570. Note that Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador look like they don't fit the trend, but they would both get Equalization payments under the base formula (instead a \"resource revenue adjustment\" is applied); furthermore, Newfoundland & Labrador recently received a quasi-bailout from the Federal government (with the transfer of part of the Muskrat Falls boondoggle from the former to the latter). In NB, 101,700 people are employed in the public sector (this isn't just provincial employees but includes other levels of government as well) out of a workforce of 355,600 (including self-employed), for a composition of 28.6%. This has increased by around 17,000 compared to 10 years ago (when the composition was 23.9%; I'm using records from August of each year to be consistent; and note that there was a dip (to 22.9% in 2016) in the intervening period), while the total size of the workforce has hardly budged—so the private sector has actually shrunk (or at least has been slower to recover from the pandemic). It's hard to look at the data and say that the public sector has been getting the short end of the stick here.\nI wasn't expecting such a strong correlation between the two variables in the graph above, but after thinking about it some more, here's my tentative explanation: \"have not\" provinces are able to support a larger public sector via Equalization than they could just from taxes and other revenue from their own economies. This is related to the goal of the program of providing roughly equivalent levels of service regardless of province. In fact, looking at the percentage of public sector workers out of the total population instead of out of the total workforce has much less variability across the country (a range of 10.3% - 15.2%). Although there is still a discrepancy between ON/AB/BC (average of 10.4%) and QC/MB/NS/NB/PE (average of 13.1%).\nSo in New Brunswick, the above-average fraction of the workforce in the public sector is closely tied to the dependency ratio (fewer people of working age to support students and retirees) that I discussed here. On a positive note, there are some encouraging signs of population growth, but this will have to be sustained and translate into a growing economy in the private sector if the services needed to support an aging population are ever to become sustainable without these increasingly-controversial transfers from the Federal government.\nRegional grievances have been a pretty regular feature of Canadian politics, so in one sense this referendum in Alberta is nothing new. On the other hand, it's one more centrifugal strain at a time when there are already a lot of domestic challenges to deal with, and the geopolitical milieu is also no longer something we can take for granted.\nSee here for more background on this referendum and here for a simulator of different equalization scenarios.\nAnother issue to keep an eye on is the current supply chain bottlenecking. It remains to be seen whether it will get better, worse, or just continue to slog along through the rest of the fall and into the winter. Like debates about interprovincial fiscal fairness, it could be an additional source of strain on our governments and institutions (along with a source of uncertainty for families and individuals, of course). I really hope we don't have strikes or railway blockades compounding the general supply chain malaise or we might truly see things fall apart.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post describes a couple of recent DIY projects I wanted to share.\nMy wife has a collection of bangles and was looking for an efficient way to store and display them. I made a board with pegs to hang them on. Here it is after the main construction (which was straightforward) was complete and after some finishing touches (where some creativity was involved):\nI used a 1x5 (4.625\" actual width) poplar board cut to approximately 34\" long. The pegs are 3/4\" dowels 3\" in length, inserted into holes drilled with a spade bit. The pegs are located 1\" from the sides of the board, ~2\" from the top and bottom; they are staggered between the sides and the vertical spacing is 7\". By the Pythagorean theorem, that gives a spacing of 4-3/8\" between the pegs, which is enough to take or replace bangles from one peg without disturbing another.\nAfter being painted, the bangle board was then sanded enough so that a bit of the wood texture still shows. Eclectic drawer pulls were used to keep the bangles from sliding off the ends and to provide some visual interest.\nAnother recent woodworking/DIY project I made was a lazy susan. It uses the same bracket that I used in my attempt at a homemade telescope. The top comprises three hardwood boards (a mix of maple and poplar) joined with glue and pegs, and with the ends cut at an angle to give an overall octagon shape.\nI decorated the top surface using a tiling motif whose pattern was in a book by Eric Broug. He provided instructions for drawing a bunch of construction lines (in pencil) then inking over the ones that are to be kept as part of the pattern. I then used a carving tool to gouge out the lines and a soldering iron to burn them into the wood for enhanced contrast. Here is the finished product:\nPermalink",

Also related on an industrial-related topic, this essay talks about the importance of the social technologies that support material production:\nMaybe more widespread industrial literacy would help in maintaining these social technologies. On a similar note, this article advocates for continued technological progress so that human flourishing and a healthy environment need not be in conflict.\nAmerica (and to a lesser extent other Western countries) used to have a culture that was good at building things, but now,\nThe essay goes on to discuss how individuals taking initiative to get a group of like-minded others together to tackle a problem used to be very normal, but current generations are educated into seeking action from authority figures instead.

Deep focus and avoiding optimizing your thoughts and writing for popularity are both very valuable.\nThe last set of links I'll share in this post are related to programming in Clojure. I used or referred to them when I was working on the program I wrote for this post, and on the one below.\nThis is an implementation I made of 1D cellular automata in Clojure:\nThe rule is a 8-digit binary number because there are 8 possible configurations for a cell and its 2 immediate neighbours that can each be on or off; each configuration is given a 1 if the cell should be on in the next iteration or a 0 if it should be off. The rule-num function converts the binary number to base 10. The lshift and rshift functions are used to look at a cell's neighbours to the left and right. Another function, lookup-val is used to get the configuration number (out of 8) corresponding to a cell and its neighbours, which is then used in next-row to look up whether that configuration requires the cell to be on or off in the next iteration according to the rule. Finally, this is all brought toghether in a for loop (the do is there because Clojure doesn't allow multiple actions (printing one row and calculating the next in this case) to occur together otherwise).\nAnd here is an example of running it:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This was a topic I wanted to learn more about, and sometimes the best way to learn something is to try to write/teach about it.\nIt's no secret that there's a lot of angst right now about social media and the internet at large. From concerns about censorship and unmasking of pseudonymous identities, to worries about how it's driving polarization/fragmentation, possibly enhanced by feedback loops with algorithmic advertising (another person worth following on these topics—the interaction between tech companies, traditional media, and social media; and the twin perils of censorship and the unchecked spread of polarizing information (whether true or false)—is Mike Solana, although I'm only going to link to one post since they mostly go behind a paywall after a few weeks).\nIn Canada, bills C-10 and C-36 will give the government more control over online content (they are unlikely to pass in this session due to the senate recessing for summer vacation, but will probably be back in one form or another). At the same time, as large language models and deepfake tools make it easier for computer-generated written and audio/visual content (respectively) to pass for something real, it will be even more important to be savvy about who and what you trust online. Control and trust—if you don't take responsibility for them yourself, you'll be increasingly vulnerable on the internet. Be prepared for more \"chaff\" online.\nIn the rest of this post, I'll be discussing some online tips and tools that are resistant to censorship. Many of them come out of the cryptocurrency space, so there can be at least some level of trust that identities are persistent (i.e. that a message is coming from the same person as a previous one; it's still caveat lector when it comes to trusting what they say).\nThe first suggestion I have is to install the Brave browser and get the Metamask cryptocurrency wallet plugin (if you download it while using the Brave browser, it should set itself up correctly). Brave is a browser that has a lot of features that respect your privacy. It generally blocks cookies and targetted ads. It also has a micropayment system: you get tokens as you view the few ads that are allowed, and can then pay/tip your favourite sites with those tokens (I tried to get setup to receive those tokens on my blog, but ran into some technical difficulties and haven't figured it out yet).\nBrave also works seamlessly with the other tools and protocols below. Here are a couple of screenshots of configuring settings related to them:\nOne of the cornerstones of the mainstream internet is DNS (domain name service). It is what allows you to type a url instead of having to know the IP address (e.g. 142.250.176.195) for the website you are trying to reach. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) offers domain names (ending in .eth) that can be paid for with cryptocurrency. They can be directed to an IP address like a conventional domain name, but they can also be directed to alternatives such as IPFS (described in more detail below).\nThese links will work on Brave, but at the time of writing they don't work on Google Chrome. However, you can always append .link to use a resolver service.\nHere are some examples of sites on ENS:\nHere's an article with more information, and another one that goes into more technical detail.\nIPFS is an alternative web protocol to http. Instead of a webpage hosted on a server with an IP address (and a domain name as described in the previous section), content in IPFS is shared on a peer-to-peer network. It's a distributed file system accessible from anywhere. All content has a unique content identifier (CID), which is used in place of a normal URL. Note that files cannot be modified after sharing (the CID is based on the hash of the file), so it only accommodates static pages. Additionally, you need to run your own node to make the files you share persistently available.\nTo view these types of webpages, follow the instructions here. Basically, on a browser like Brave that supports the protocol, you can type ipfs://<CID> into the browser address bar. Otherwise, you can use a gateway as follows: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>. In either case, <CID> gets replaced with the CID of the content you're looking for. Here are a couple of examples:\nTo share anything on IPFS, you need to download the desktop application (unlike viewing them, which can be done in a browser). Follow the instructions here. This makes your computer a node in the peer-to-peer network, so it places some demands on your computer's resources. I've noticed network traffic in the hundreds of kbps (occasionally spiking to 1 Mbps or a bit higher); it also ties up some CPU cycles and RAM. The settings do allow for limiting how much storage space the IPFS network can utilize on your computer:\nIt's common to pair IPFS with an ENS domain.\nEthmail lets you use an Ethereum address to send/receive email. You'll need the MetaMask plug-in (or some other supported wallet) to digitally sign the login. I tried sending a message to my hotmail address and it got blocked, but I received a message that I sent myself on Ethmail alright. If you want to use it to send me a message, this is the Ethereum address I check (occasionally).\nBitclout is a new social network that is similar to Twitter. It has a cryptocurrency tie-in that lets users monetarily support other users they appreciate, but this doesn't appear to be necessary to use the site: you can post, like, and comment without getting into the speculative financial aspect of the network. They give you a nominal amount of their token (used to setup a profile) when you verify your phone number, or as an alternative you can choose to make an initial deposit using Bitcoin. I think this step serves to limit fake/spam accounts. It has attracted some controversy, though.\nI set up a profile there to at least reserve my name. I'm not sure how much I'll end up using it, because the biggest value of a social network is who's on it and so far I don't think I know anyone there. Bitclout is just the latest attempt at starting a social network as an alternative to the big ones that can currently feel like near-monopolies. I've checked out Minds before—although it doesn't appear to have much momentum at the moment—and another one I've heard of is Mastodon.  The most valuable thing about a social network is the people who are on it, so these platforms do tend towards being natural monopolies due to network effects. If nothing else, continued attempts to make alternative social networks might apply some competitive pressure to keep the heavyweights honest.\nHere are some links related to the themes of this post (ranging from more tips for setting these things up, to micropayments, to the potential of the broader cryptocurrency sphere, to link rot, to how to wisely interact online and resist polarization). These are important issues to think about, in my opinion; these articles aren't the last word on these topics but hopefully you'll find them thought-provoking. The final link in this list is a compelling short story:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Some suggestions from me and my wife's experience last fall.\nBefore we got married, both of us considered family highly important. We’re now around eight months into our marriage and this sentiment has only increased. Two truly are better than one. We’re both very glad that we didn’t delay getting married, in spite of the restrictions associated with the coronavirus pandemic that made some aspects of our wedding (especially who we could have be there) different than they would have been under ideal circumstances. In spite of these restrictions, we were both still very pleased with how the wedding went; it also stayed well within our budget. Because we want to encourage other couples not to let finances be a barrier to getting married (or wedding costs being a heavy debt burden from day one), we thought it would be nice to share from our experience some of the ways we found to save money on our wedding while still having a day we’ll both remember fondly for a lifetime.\nFirst of all, and probably most importantly, we made sure we were on the same page about the wedding budget. This included tallying up how much we were willing to spend, as well as an exercise to identify our priorities. Some of the specific ways we saved money are unique to us—like the officiant waiving a fee/honorarium because he’s the bride’s father—but this process we followed is something that any couple could use. We tried to narrow things down to our top three priorities (individually, then merging our lists) for tangible and intangible aspects. An example of a tangible priority is having an attractive and unique venue; an example of an intangible priority is hospitality—making sure guests are comfortable and have a good time. Once we’d settled on a budget and identified priorities, the more detailed planning that followed benefitted from already having a shared big picture perspective established. This made the planning process a nice time of working together towards a common goal rather than becoming a source of conflict.\nAnother thing we tried to keep in mind was the “project management triangle”: good, fast, or cheap—pick at most two. Less pithily, this is the notion that there’s a trade-off to be made between quality/scope, schedule constraints, and price.  For us, trying to have an affordable wedding was not about pinching every penny, but rather a focus on aligning spending with what we (and our guests) would really value and remember. That meant that the aspects we’d identified as our top priorities were areas where we aimed for the high-quality corner of the triangle, while for other aspects we felt more comfortable aiming for the affordable corner of the triangle. The choice of venue was an area where the schedule constraints corner of the triangle really came into play. With the frequent changes last fall in what was permitted in terms of gatherings, a major factor in our choice of venue was their flexibility to roll with the changing regulations (including making their deposit refundable).\nOther principles we used in our planning process and think other couples could also take advantage of were accepting offers of help from family (we didn’t solicit/pressure anyone to help, but gratefully accepted any offers), aiming for reusability for décor items, and getting multiple quotes for key services. It quickly became apparent that the most expensive line items would be catering, photography, and the venue rental so we researched and compared multiple options for each of these, and tried not to get completely set on one before thoroughly evaluating the options. Providing a good meal for guests was one of our priorities, so we didn’t mind catering being the most expensive line item. However, we still explored several options to make sure we could serve something that would be sure to satisfy while staying within our budget. For the photography, we also got several quotes and came to the realization that going with an established professional photographer would tie up almost half of our planned budget on a single line item that we hadn’t identified as a top priority. So when our sister-in-law volunteered to take some pictures (a win-win arrangement since she’s trying to build up a portfolio) we gratefully accepted—and the photos turned out beautifully!\nGetting some nice décor without spending a lot on it was a great opportunity to get creative! For the wedding ceremony, we used a hand-made trellis and a couple of potted palm trees as the backdrop. The trellis is now installed in our garden and the trees provide some greenery in our living room. We also bought a nice rug to stand on; it’s now in our bedroom. These were things we wanted anyway, so we didn’t really count them as part of the wedding budget. And we continue to enjoy them today. For the reception, the table cloths/runners were sewn by family members using some nice fabric repurposed from second-hand curtains. The décor on the tables included various bronze items (candlesticks, vases, etc.) that were mostly purchased second-hand and some old books with nice bindings (which we already had). Table numbers were written with chalk on floor tiles (which we plan to use for a future home reno project); nametags to help guests find their seats were made from maps cut from an out-of-date atlas (another thing we purchased second-hand). Almost everything had either already been used, or we knew we would use again—neither of us like the idea of buying stuff that would be used once then discarded.\nIn the last section of this article, we’ll go over some other details of how our wedding came together. While these examples are specific to us and not as transferrable as the planning principles and processes/strategies laid out in previous paragraphs, perhaps they can spark some inspiration nonetheless.\nPermalink",

    "content": "The Chronicles of Narnia is one of my favourite children's series. Every good fantasy novel is incomplete without a map. While the Narnia books include some maps, they tend to focus on the area where each book is set; there is a comprehensive map in the back of some editions, but it is in colour (rather than the more typical style of fantasy maps) and hard to find in high resolution. So I thought it would be fun to try assembling a comprehensive map of Narnia.\nHere's the map I came up with (right click and open it in another tab to zoom in for more detail):\nTo make this map, I overlaid 4 maps from different books (The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair) in the GNU Image Manipulation Program, using the transparency function to assist with placement. I erased overlapping parts to try to keep the best details in each area. Finally, I used the cloning tool and did some manual touch-ups to smooth things out and fill in the white space a bit more.\nHere's what it looked like when it was a work in progress. The contributions from the four different maps can be seen:\nSomething notable about the maps of Narnia (considering it's in the genres of fantasy and children's literature) is that the scale is realistic. The country of Narnia itself is around 90 miles from East to West and 60 miles from North to South. If it was rectangular, its area would be 5,400 sq. mi., or about the size of Montenegro. It centres on a fertile river valley and is hemmed in by hills/mountains on the three sides that aren't coastal. In the following paragraphs, I'll discuss some of the key places and journeys from the seven books in the series, and compare them to real-world geography where applicable.\nIn The Magician's Nephew, most of the action in Narnia takes place around [the future location of] Lantern Waste in the northwest. There is also a visit made to a garden in the mountains far to the west (not shown on this map). The return leg of the journey takes most of a day until sunset, flying on a pegasus. Assuming 12 hours at a flight speed similar to an eagle (50 km/h), that distance would be up to 375 miles (600 km)—much more than the width of Narnia proper. This first book in the series also gives an aerial view of the lay of the land:\nThe second book in the series is the best known: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. It starts in Lantern Waste. After that, most of the key events take place along the Great River. Miraz' castle hasn't been built by this point, but three of the Pevensie children initially go to the Beavers' lodge at the nearby confluence and the other child, Edmund, goes to the White Witch's castle a short distance north/upriver. The climax occurs at Aslan's How (the Stone Table at that point in time); it is followed by a battle at Beruna and a coronation at the castle of Cair Paravel on the coast.\nThe third book, The Horse and His Boy, is one of my favourites. It is also the one that involves the most travel and is thus well-suited for discussing with reference to a map. It starts off in the country of Calormen to the south of Narnia. It is a much bigger country: Shasta and Bree take weeks to reach the capital of Tashbaan on the northern border, and they didn't even start from the southern extremity.  So Calormen is a few hundred miles from north to south at a minimum. From Tashbaan, they cross the desert to Archenland in the mountains on Narnia's southern border. The desert is about 60 miles wide according to the map, but their route leads them to a narrow gorge (easy to overlook if you don't know about it) where they can find water and shade, getting out of the fierce desert conditions after only 45 miles or so. They started their journey across the desert after midnight, and it was well after dark by the time they reached the gorge; the travel speed seems realistic including breaks. The width of the desert also seems realistic for providing a military buffer between the Calormen empire and the much smaller independent kingdoms of Archenland and Narnia. A Calormen prince brings a small force across the desert to attack Archenland, but larger armies have slower movement speeds, and the necessity to carry enough water quickly makes the logistics prohibitive unless the desert can be crossed quickly. There is some interesting discussion about these logistics here:\n(I also recently read a book titled The Secret History of the Mongol Queens, and it mentioned how they had a military advantage by being able to conduct military operations across the Gobi Desert, unlike the settled peoples to the south of it).\nThe mountain range containing the tiny kingdom of Archenland appears to be 25 to 40 miles wide from north to south. The core area around the castle of Anvard probably isn't much bigger than Andorra (180 sq. mi.), although they are nominally sovereign over much of the range. A good comparison for the size of this mountain range is probably the interior of Wales; the Appalachian mountains in Pennsylvania are a bit more extensive (it's 65 miles from Harrisburg to Williamsport), but also in the right order of magnitude.\nThe Prince Caspian era (which covers that book and the next two) is when the map above is most valid. Caspian was the tenth of his name. Comparing the timeline of French kings (King Louis X reigned c. 1300 while King Louis I reigned c. 825), the Telmarine invasion of Narnia had probably been almost 500 years before his time. The castle where he was raised (Miraz' castle) had been built by his great-great-grandfather, likely 80 - 100 years earlier. The land of Telmar isn't shown on this map, but seems to have been to the southwest. In Prince Caspian, the Pevensie children (and a dwarf they meet) row from Cair Paravel up the Glasswater, then travel overland to Aslan's How. The walking part of their journey would have been about 30 miles; they stop to camp a couple of times, but the slow speed makes sense considering they were travelling through a dense woods and had to backtrack due to obstacles.\nThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the only book in the series that takes place on the ocean and islands of Narnia. This part of the map seems like it is not to scale. The Dawn Treader sailed from Cair Paravel to Galma (20 miles on the map) in a day; Galma to Terebinthia (40 miles on the map) took 4 days but required rowing due to not having favourable winds; it took 8 days to sail from Terebinthia to the Seven Isles (75 miles on the map); it also took 8 days to travel from the Seven Isles to the Lone Isles (140 miles on the map), but the book mentioned that they were making very good speed. It was on this last leg that Lucy, Edmund, and Eustace joined the ship, 6 days and 400 leagues after it had left the Seven Isles. The distances on the map imply a speed of around 10 to 20 miles per day—less than one mile per hour. However, pre-modern ships could sail at around 4 knots / 4.5 mph; furthermore, covering 400 leagues (1200 nautical miles) in six days as the book says means that the Dawn Treader can sail at over 8 knots (fast but achievable for a sailing ship). The discrepancy between distances on the map and what is stated in the text (which aligns better with plausible sailing speeds) suggests that the ocean part of the map above is not to the same scale as the land portion. A possible reason for the difference in scale could be that the islands are shown at the right latitude but the longitude is depicted less precisely. Pre-modern navigational instruments were, in fact, much better for measuring latitude than longitude (although given that Narnia is canonically a flat world, I don't know how celestial navigation techniques would translate).\nThe Silver Chair is the only book to explore the lands north of Narnia. Eustace and Jill meet up with a marshwiggle named Puddleglum in the big marsh in the northeast of Narnia, then travel north to the land of giants (Harfang castle and its surroundings) through the moorlands and mountains. They end up in an underground kingdom and eventually end up back in Narnia. I wish the book had spent more time exploring the marsh, since wetlands are a biome I'm fond of.\nThe action in the final book, The Last Battle, doesn't travel around as much as the others; it mainly takes place in a few locations in the vicinity of Lantern Waste. The Ape that is the villain of that book initially lives in a treehouse by the waterfall that marks the western border of Narnia. It is not shown on the map above, but was mentioned in the excerpt from The Magician's Nephew. The waterfall is on the branch of the Great River that flows through Lantern Waste. The barn where the Ape sets up his headquarters is also more-or-less in the vicinity of Lantern Waste. This book is set 200 years (7 generations between Tirian and Rilian) after The Silver Chair.\nIf you enjoyed this post, then you may be interested in this article about the history of the typical style of fantasy maps (and the author has a whole category about fantasy maps on his blog). And someone made a map of my hometown in that same style.\nPermalink",

    "content": "When I wrote last year's version of this post, the Coronavirus pandemic was just becoming apparent in North America. Since then, most of us have obviously had our expectations for 2020 disrupted, and public finances were no exception. In this post, I want to compare what was planned for the past year in the New Brunswick provincial budget with what actually happened, as well as with the government's plan for the year ahead.\nTo start with, here are my usual explanatory notes: I try to keep most of the amounts in millions (M) of dollars (CAD) because I think it's easier to compare than mixing million and billions. And while I'll mostly refer to it as the 2021 budget, it is technically for the 2021-2022 fiscal year.\nIn the post below, I'll review the numbers from the new budget (with special attention to the differences between the 2020 budget and the revised numbers now that we're at the end of the fiscal year) then I'll try to briefly summarize some of the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the allusion in the title, New Brunswick has weathered the pandemic better than a lot of places, not only in health outcomes, but also with respect to the economic impact. For example, the unemployment rate here is currently less than the Canada-wide average (8.9% vs 9.4%). Finally, I'll give an update on the province's demographic trends, which was the theme of my post last year.\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nAccording to the budget document, the net debt by the end of the fiscal year will represent around 36% of GDP. The Canadian federal government's debt-to-GDP is around 63%, so the combined liability to taxpayers is close to the psychologically-significant 100% of GDP mark. It's also interesting to look at the debt load per capita. In NB, this is $17,600 (provincial debt only); quite a few provinces are higher than this, although some have stronger economies to go with it: MB, AB, QC, NL, and ON.\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nOn the revenue side of the 2021 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nNote that the taxes are spread among a number of categories (income, sales, property, corporate income, gas, carbon, tobacco, etc.). Equalization provides around 22% of the revenue to the province's coffers.\nThe following pair of graphs show the budgeted expenditures by department and the budgeted revenue by source. For the past year (which was notably abnormal), I've graphed last year's budgeted amounts (blue), the revised totals at the end of the fiscal year (orange), and the budgeted amounts for the fiscal year ahead (grey). They are shown on a logarithmic scale so that relative changes show up better.\nLooking at these graphs, the first thing I want to discuss is how the pandemic affected spending and revenue compared to last years' budget (which came out just a couple of weeks before restrictions were imposed). On the spending side, some departments had more work to do and thus higher expenditures. Others may have had savings from not having facilities open or not being able to run programs like usual. The Legislature (not shown on the graph as it isn't a major department) had a 25% ($8M) increase in spending, which I assume was due to costs associated with virtual meetings along with extra safety precautions for in-person meetings. The department of Environment and Local Government got around $40M extra last year for administrative support for local governments; this was a one-off supplement in response to the pandemic. Other departments that got Covid-designated funding added on after the main budget came out were: Health ($134M), Public Safety ($42M, which I assume included paying for peace officers at points of entry to deliver quarantine orders to arrivees), and Social Development ($20M - this is the department responsible for long-term care homes). The 2021 budget includes a continuation of this funding for pandemic operations, but at a reduced amount (around half, which might be a guess at how long into the upcoming fiscal year these added operational costs are expected to be needed).\nDespite the drastic disruptions in society last year, most departments only had a difference of a few percent between what they were budgeted and the revised numbers at the end of the fiscal year. This illustrates the inertia of the ship of state.\nThe revenues from the biggest taxes (income tax and HST) were down 5% last year from what had been expected—because residents of New Brunswick were earning less and spending less due to the pandemic and associated restrictions—and they aren't expected to recover to the levels budgeted for 2020 in 2021. Personal income tax revenue is expected to be even lower in 2021 than the actual amount received in 2020, I assume because it is influenced by how much someone made in the previous year.\nIn the 2020 fiscal year, declines in tax revenue were more-or-less offset by one-time increases in transfers from the Federal government designated for fighting the pandemic. The notable line items were $219M for the \"Safe Restart Agreement\" and $40M for the \"Safe Return to Class Fund\".\nFor the 2021 budget, there are modest but real increases (4.4-6.3%, so around 5% each) to spending on health, education, and social development. These four departments (post-secondary education is in a separate department from K-12 education) have a combined budget increase of almost $330M. This is in a year when revenue growth is basically flat: there is a 1% increase in the overall revenue, but that is mainly due to special agencies/accounts and the ordinary account revenue is actually down by $4M.\nAt the time of writing, the pandemic has claimed 30 lives in NB. This is under 4 per 100,000. To put this in context, the number of deaths from all causes the year before was 7,945 (equal to 1,017 per 100,000). So the Covid-19 pandemic has caused less than 0.4% of the number of typical annual deaths here. Looking at our neighbours (outside of Atlantic Canada, which has been fairly similar), the death rate so far from the pandemic per 100,000 people has been 124 in Quebec, 53 in Maine, 87 in New Hampshire, 33 in Vermont, and 236 in Massachusetts (US data from CDC). Maine and Vermont had the two lowest rates in the US, so being an out-of-the-way place with a low population density certainly appears to be an advantage when it comes to avoiding the worst of the pandemic. The hardest-hit US state was New Jersey, with 266 deaths per 100,000 people. It's hard to say how much different policies—rather than just lower density and more geographic isolation—led to Atlantic Canada having a lower direct impact from the pandemic compared to these other jurisdictions. When speaking of differences in policies, the main thing that stands out is effective control at the border (including quarantines for people who do need to travel), since other jurisdictions have also promoted/mandated mask-wearing and had lockdowns (Quebec even has had curfews). To the extent policies (rather than geography or luck) have kept NB from being as hard-hit as Quebec, we can estimate they've saved (well, extended) hundreds (but not thousands) of lives.\nAlong with its toll in lives and sickness, the pandemic and/or the restrictions brought in to fight it have had an economic impact. In the previous section, I pointed out how provincial revenues fell short of expectations, largely because citizens and residents were earning less and spending less. Of course, this affects not only public coffers, but the broader provincial economy.\nThe finance department has a nice dashboard website showing a variety of indicators on the provincial economy. Here are a few that are especially interesting:\nThe unemployment rate is currently at 8.9% (it changed slightly since I collected these screenshots), compared to a pre-Covid baseline of around 8%. However, it's generally been dropping from month to month so hopefully will be back to normal (or better) soon. It reached a high of over 13% in April and May of 2020. Another tile in the dashboard shows that workers' (i.e. only counting employed people) average monthly earnings increased 6.5% in April 2020, which indicates that most of the layoffs were concentrated in low-wage jobs. Total wages and salaries paid in NB by month were $1314M in May 2020 (which was the lowest since Oct. 2017), but had climbed to $1450M in December 2020. This is 1.7% higher than a year earlier, so can be seen as a modest sign of recovery.\nRestaurants (from the middle tile shared above) still have monthly sales 15% lower than a year ago (just before the pandemic). While the worst trough was short-lived, this sector of the economy is still far from being fully recovered. In contrast, retail trade (not shown, but the tile can be seen on the linked dashboard) was 5% higher in December 2020 compared to a year prior. Looking at another sector of the economy, domestic exports are also down (11.6% year-over-year in January 2021), but there is a lot of variability/noise in this graph anyway; for example, there was a drop in the fall of 2018 of around the same magnitude as the spring of 2020 at the start of the pandemic.\nBuilding permits (the tile on the right) are clearly booming, at least for residential construction. This statistic might include renovations (I'm not sure), but building starts are also up. A couple of posts ago, I noted high lumber prices. The high demand associated with all of this residential construction is surely a contributor to that.\nIn the next section, I'll have more to discuss about population trends, but I wanted to pull a couple of stats from the dashboard here. Out of the past 20 quarters shown, seven of them had a natural decrease (deaths exceeding births) of over 400. This is a consequence of an aging population and below-replacement birthrate. The highest natural decrease in a quarter was 645. However, 14 of the past 20 quarters had a net migration (immigration plus people moving from other parts of Canada minus people moving out of the province) greater than 645, so this offsets the natural decrease and allows for a modest growth. The current population of NB is now over 782,000 people.\nThis is a numbers-driven post, but I don't want to leave this section without acknowledging the non-quantifiable impacts that the pandemic and the restrictions brought in to fight it have had on individuals and households across the province. People have missed being with loved ones in their final moments and have been unable in some cases to mark their grief with a proper funeral. Weddings have been postponed, or gone ahead with some special friends and family absent (as for my wife and I). Other life milestones, from birthdays to graduations, have passed with very muted celebration. Surgeries and medical tests have been delayed. Loneliness and uncertainty about the future have strained mental health for many. Some business owners have seen their hard work and dreams crumble. Vacation plans have been shelved or cancelled. And the list could go on and on. I don't have answers or solutions to these things, but I wanted to at least ensure they're not invisible when talking about the costs of the past year, in spite of not having a dollar figure attached.\nAs I mentioned in the introduction, I wanted to follow up on the demographic realities facing New Brunswick that I discussed when last years' budget came out. I saw an article with a detailed breakdown of population changes across the province in 2020, so I used the information in it to make the following graph:\nHere are some explanatory notes about this graph:\nFredericton, Moncton, and Saint John (averaged between them) have almost enough births to balance out deaths and maintain a steady population. This is not the case for northern cities (Miramichi, Edmundston, Bathurst, Campbellton) and rural regions. These latter regions also have a population drain from intraprovincial migration, which is Fredericton and Moncton's gain. However, the larger cities (on average, mainly driven by Fredericton) have more net migration to other parts of Canada. In contrast, northern cities and rural regions had net migration from the rest of Canada (people coming [back] to retire, perhaps?). International immigration is almost enough to balance out population losses in northern and rural NB, while being a significant driver of growth in the larger cities.\nAs I explained last year, increasing the population of New Brunswick is a good idea to maintain a workforce and tax base as more and more of the current population approaches retirement. From the analysis above, I think each region should lean into its strengths. That is, northern and rural NB should continue to try to attract migration from other parts of Canada. The larger cities should aim to keep immigration and birthrates up (and among my friends and acquaintances, there seems to be a mini baby boom going on at the moment!).  A net growth rate of +150 per 10,ooo people per year across the whole province would get us to a million people by 2040. Currently only Moncton meets that, but other regions should try to get there.\nThere was a highlight in the press release for the budget that sounds to me like a good strategy to grow the provincial population and economy with some targeted self-promotion:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post contains a review of Lotharingia: A Personal History of Europe's Lost Country by Simon Winder, along with a bit of programming practice I did recently.\nLotharingia is a history/travel book about the swath of Europe where French and Germanic cultural regions come into contact—and frequently, over the centuries, conflict. This territory may be generally considered as a strip extending westward from the Rhine for up to a few hundred kilometres. The author refers to it as Lotharingia, for reasons that will become apparent. The book is written in a conversational style; the author is British and this shows up in the form of some dry humour and an attitude of wry bemusement at Continental goings-on:\nLotharingia covers the history of its titular territory from Charlemagne to post-World War II. It also includes a fair bit of art history (something Winder is clearly passionate about) and the mention or recommendation of numerous points of interest. Here is how Winder summarizes the theme of the book:\nAfter Charlemagne, his empire was divided in three pieces by his grandsons in 843. The western and eastern portions become the seminal territories of France and Germany, respectively. The central portion (stretching from Northern Italy to the modern Netherlands) went to the oldest, who was named Lothair. His son, Lothair II, saw the territory split further, with northern Italy and Provence inherited by siblings. The remaining territory north of the Alps became known as Lotharingia, after his name.\nLotharingia was short-lived as an independent entity and ended up getting absorbed by the eastern kingdom (which would become the Holy Roman Empire about a century later). But this was not an entirely stable configuration, and it would end up getting passed around quite a few times over the centuries.\nA notable incarnation of this territory was Burgundy, which was ruled by 4 dukes from 1363 to 1477, then inherited by a duchess who married a Habsburg.\nFollowing the Reformation, the Thirty Years' War raged heavily in this area. The Palatinate was especially devastated. At the same time, the Dutch revolt saw the northern portion of the low countries gain independence from the Spanish/Habsburgs. The southern portion, however, remained under their control until things got rearranged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars.\nA part of Lotharingia that I found very interesting was seeing how choices made after Napoleon was defeated set the stage in a way for World War 1 (via the Franco-Prussian War). Prussia really became dominant in Germany during this era; despite its origins in the northeast, it acquired territories along the Rhine. This was at least in part because their military strength was seen as a counterweight to France:\nSomething that really hit home from reading this book was the unprecedented destructiveness of World War 1. And then World War 2 (on the western front) played out over the same territory.\nA thesis of Winder's book is that it isn't a coincidence that both World Wars and numerous previous conflicts (the Franco-Prussian war, the Napoleonic wars, the Thirty Years' War, the Burgundian wars, etc.) occurred over the same geography. The divisions of Charlemagne's empire (and going back even further, the Rhine was part of the border of the Roman empire) kept showing up. Winder concludes his book in the aftermath of World War 2, when a fresh approach was tried. This was the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor to the European Union.\nWith the historical outline covered, I wanted to share some various things I found interesting from reading Lotharingia. First of all, there are a lot of notable dynasties in European history with a Lotharingian connection. The Habsburg's ancestral castle is on the Aare River, a left-bank tributary of the Rhine in what is now northern Switzerland. The ancestral castle of the House of Nassau is just outside the territories discussed here, on a right-bank tributary of the Rhine, but only 20 km outside Koblenz. Some of their descendants are still the Grand Dukes of Luxembourg; and, of course, others of their descendants in the House of Orange-Nassau would end up ruling the Netherlands. The ancestral castles of a couple of other prominent German ruling families, the Hohenzollerns and Hohenstaufens, aren't far outside Lotharingia either.\nBritish royal succession also took a detour through Lotharingia, as described in a section of Winder's book. King James I (Stuart) had a daughter, Elizabeth, who married the elector Palatine. Her daughter, Sophia, had a son (George I), who became the first king in the Hanover dynasty after the end of the Stuart dynasty. The last Stuart monarchs were William & Mary (who brought an army from the Netherlands—another Lotharingian connection—in 1688) and Queen Anne. But Queen Mary died childless and none of Queen Anne's children survived childhood, so there was a dynastic succession. This paragraph will probably make more sense with reference to the family tree.\nAnother thing I found interesting is that although both originated out of Charlemagne's empire, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire were structured very differently. The former was as centralized as possible, but Winder describes the latter in contrasting terms:\nThe more decentralized nature of the Holy Roman Empire is reflected in the diversity of statuses that different cities and regions had in the empire. For example, there were \"free cities\" (part of the Empire without being part of any subsidiary Duchy or Principality) and ecclesiastical cities which were ruled by Prince-Bishops. Three of these even had the status of Imperial Electors: Trier (which had been Constantine's capital), Cologne, Mainz—all of these are in the area discussed in Lotharingia, as was the (non-Electorate) Prince-Bishopric of Liège.\nWinder describes abbeys (he mentions Maulbronn and Altenberg as nice examples) and guilds as important contributors to European history and technological development:\nI also found this statement to be thought-provoking:\n(Here's a short clip from a lecture that touches on the same issue).\nFinally, I'll share a tidbit (in the context of logistics for sieges) that I felt was in the same vein as Harvesting the Biosphere:\nThat's 50 pounds per horse.\nBecause Simon Winder mentions a lot of interesting places in his book, I thought it would be interesting to chart a route that visits some of them. Calculating an efficient route between a number of stops is known as the \"travelling salesman problem\". I decided to try writing a little program in Clojure to tackle this exercise.\nI picked ten cities or towns mentioned in Lotharingia (the choices are discussed a bit more below), listed them in alphabetical order (from Aachen to Tournai) and prepared a matrix of the distances between them (in degrees, as the Euclidean/Pythagorean distance based on their latitudes and longitudes). Because Clojure doesn't really distinguish between data and code, I could use this matrix (a vector of vectors, technically) the same way as I would a function. Here is a brief description of how it and the rest of the program/script work:\nHere is an example of running this script:\nNote that \"no change\" is printed more frequently as it gets close to the end. This is because the decreasing simulated annealing temperature as time goes by makes it less likely that a permutation will be accepted if it results in a longer route. The purpose of giving a higher probability of accepting longer routes early on is that a route that is ultimately shorter might take a few steps of rearranging to reach; those steps could temporarily lengthen it, so insisting that every change result in a shorter route could result in the program getting trapped in a dead-end that is far from optimized.\nAnother thing to note is that the shortest distance in the run above (16.32) was not the final answer. Nor is it the best solution: I ran the program multiple other times and the shortest distance I found was 15.05. Even that may not be the absolute optimal answer. So this program has room for improvement; this exercise was intended to illustrate the travelling salesman problem and simulated annealing, but it certainly isn't an optimized solution. Check out this interactive simulation for a more powerful implementation of this kind of approach.\nI took the best solution my program came up with and mapped it out in Google Maps (it wouldn't allow for a closed route). This is a similar distance to the tour of the Maritimes I suggested here, by the way.\nTo wrap this post up, here are some notes from Lotharingia about the places listed on this route:\nThere are also UNESCO sites that sound interesting in a few other places in Lotharingia: Charleroi, Trier, Nancy, Berne, and Speyer.\nPermalink",

Here's a picture of it:\nThe top surface has space for baskets of bread and fruit. On the right hand side there are shelves for cookbooks and napkins/placemats. On the left, trays and baking sheets can be slotted between some vertical dowels.\nThe structure is built from \"project boards\": softwood strips laminated together to make a 36\" x 12\" board. I trimmed them to 30\" long for both the horizontal and vertical pieces.  They are joined together with glue and with dowel pins; while the glue was drying, I used some assembly clamps and tie-down straps to hold everything in place. Here is a picture while the main structure of the cart was under construction:\nAside from the project boards, I also used some caster wheels, some dowel rods, and some nominal 1\"x2\"s—the latter support the middle shelf on the right hand side and the vertical dowels on the left.\nWhen I was buying the supplies for this project, I noticed that the wood I used cost a lot. If you've done any building projects recently, you've probably noticed the same thing. The commodity price for lumber reflects this:\nPermalink",

Also on the subject of math, check out this video on Penrose tiling.\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin rely on some pretty advanced math. In this article, Balaji Srinivasan, a tireless advocate of the tech industry, discusses potential applications of their underlying blockchain technology:\nThe interoperability is a huge advantage over conventional databases and other online services, in his view.\nAnother prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world, Vitalik Buterin, reflects on 2020:\nJoseph Tainter and Peter Turchin are scholars who study societal crises and collapses. It's probably fair to say that their ideas are relevant at the moment. One of Tainter's key points is that societies get more complex over time and eventually the resulting lack of flexibility becomes a vulnerability. One of Turchin's key points is that the size of the would-be ruling class grows more quickly than the number of available leadership positions; as competition for high-status positions intensifies, the stability of the overall society is compromised.\nOn a more upbeat note, VC and essayist Paul Graham shares about how his life changed after having kids. Whether in families, businesses, or communities, I think keeping the next generation in mind is very important. To survive and thrive long-term, organizations need to be intentional about passing on both leadership skills and positions of power. Starting afresh each generation loses the benefits of institutional knowledge.\nI'm not going to include too many links about the Covid pandemic and its possible aftermath, but here's one suggesting that decamping from the priciest cities could be a significant trend. Here are some semi-related thoughts. Hand in hand with remote work, here's a virtual museum to enjoy, while we wait to be able to travel to real ones again. Also, Megan McArdle is thankful for supply chains and the people who manage them, and the way they kept working through 2020.\nThis is a nice article from my hometown's tourism department about paddling among the islands just upriver from the city. I've been enjoying this series on how things like iron and grain were produced in the classical and medieval world. And here's a neat compilation of factoids and links on \"rewilding\".\nIn international news, Ethiopia is building a massive dam on the Nile River (although I don't know how the civil war there will affect progress on it). It's a source of tension in the region of northeast Africa, but this article suggests it could eventually lead to more cooperation by increasing the importance of diplomatic negotiations on water management.\nTurning from water to fire, this article explains how controlled burns can be an invaluable tool to avoid uncontrolled megafires; it says that the state of California has a \"burn backlog\" of 20 million acres. However,\nI believe Canada's immigration system gets a lot of things right. One of those things is private refugee sponsorship.\nI was reminded of Hans Rosling by the statement here that, \"given the scale of what we have achieved already and what is possible for the future, I think it’s irresponsible to only report on how dreadful our situation is.\"\nCulinary applications of seaweed is something I've mentioned in a previous post. Last but not least, this paper on the balance between kelp beds and sea urchins in marine ecosystems adapted my implementation of cellular automata in a spreadsheet in their modelling. It's always nice to be cited!\nPermalink",

    "content": "My customary annual retrospective.\nAt the start of the year, I mentioned I intended to reduce my blogging frequency to one or two posts per month. I didn't even hit that target (ending up with 9 posts)—but I had a very good reason: this year I got engaged and married! I'll have a bit more on that below, but first a run-down of my top posts (in my opinion) of 2020.\nMy favourite blog posts that I wrote in 2020 were a few entries that contained book reviews but also brought in a fair bit of other material on their subjects. There was a two part series (the second part was published just into 2021, but I'm counting it for last year since that's when I did the reading and most of the other research that went into it) on the history and outlook of shipping (trade and naval activities) in the Indian Ocean region and a look at growing biomass (including but not limited to algae) for fun and profit food, feed, fuel, and fibre.\nHere is the list of the posts from this year:\nTo go back further in the archives, check out previous year-end posts:\nI already have some ideas for post topics in 2021, starting with some interesting links I've rounded up. We'll see how many I get to.\n2020 will be a year that stands out in my memory for sure. I know many people had a very hard time due to the pandemic, whether as a result of illness, job losses, or coping with isolation; I'm sympathetic to that. However, for me personally it was a watershed year. From getting engaged early in the year to going ahead with our wedding (there were some limitations due to Covid-19 protocols, but we were still able to celebrate with local family and friends) to starting to get set up as a combined household there were a lot of causes for joy in my relationship with my now-wife. I'm also grateful that there has been a semblance of normalcy in the (currently-suspended) \"Atlantic bubble\", albeit at the cost of travel restrictions to the rest of Canada, let alone outside the country.\nA belated Happy New Year to all my readers!\nPermalink",

    "content": "Here's the promised forward-looking Part 2 to the historical book reviews from Part 1.\nIn the previous part of this series, I wrote about some of the history of the Indian Ocean. In this part, I'll be looking at the geopolitical outlook of the region (including the South China Sea as it it integrally connected to the Indian Ocean and is also a monsoon sea). As with last time, I'll be drawing on a couple of books I read: Sea Power: The History and Geopolitics of the World's Oceans by Admiral James Stavridis (published in 2017) and Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power by Robert Kaplan (published in 2010). Both authors have views that I assume are fairly typical in the American foreign policy establishment, since one is a retired admiral and the other has been a fellow at foreign policy think-tanks. Because, unlike history, current events can have a lot of developments in the time since these books were published, this post will also incorporate a lot of online information as updates. It is also worth keeping in mind that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated some trends and stalled others.\nFirst of all, since a picture is worth a thousand words, this screenshot (source) tells you why you should care about the Indian Ocean and the countries that border it.\nAdmiral Stavridis emphasizes the large fraction of global shipping that takes place on the Indian Ocean:\nKaplan also provides statistics on the amount of oil that moves through the Strait of Malacca, which he describes as:\nOf the overall region, he says:\nWith the importance of the topic established, I'm going to go through some things I learned from each book (with updates or additional commentary where suitable) then wrap up with some other interesting material about the region.\nThe most interesting part of Sea Power is the author. Adm. Stavridis worked his way up from a junior officer to a stint as the Supreme Commander of NATO. The book contains many of his impressions and recollections of the places he's sailed and the people he's met. His personal experiences include being present at a meeting between Donald Rumsfeld and Lee Kuan Yew, and having as a friend a Turkish General who was arrested by the Erdogan regime for alleged sedition. Most of the chapters of Sea Power (up until the end where it turns to recommendations for future US naval policy) focus on a particular ocean and combine these kinds of career recollections with a brief and breezy overview of the naval history there, followed by his perspective on the current geopolitical situation (primarily as it relates to challenges and opportunities for the US Navy). The Indian Ocean and South China Sea only comprise a portion of this book, but it will be my focus here, although Adm. Stavridis certainly has plenty to say about the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic that was also of interest.\nOne of the themes of Sea Power is the way in which the world's oceans are connected but also separate. I saw the following map on Twitter and added a few labels to illustrate this:\nThe section on the Indian Ocean gives his impressions of transiting the Strait of Malacca and the Suez Canal, and visiting ports of Manama (the capital of Bahrain and the base of the US Fifth Fleet), Singapore, and Diego Garcia. He had tours of duty in the Persian Gulf and the Horn of Africa; he was also involved in relief efforts following the tsunami of 2004. Because I've recently read books about the history of this region, I found his treatment of it to be kind of sparse. For example, Stavridis writes that,\nIn contrast, the previous entry in this series shows that they were frequently key axes of global trade. Although from his perspective as a military man, perhaps it is fair to admit that much of that trade in historical eras was in luxuries (spices and silks, for example) whereas now it is in necessities and thus has become an area vital to logistics and strategic considerations.\nHis contrasting impressions of the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean from a sailor's perspective stood out:\nHere's Admiral Stavridis' summary of some of the key geopolitical issues in the Indian Ocean. He makes it clear that he sees it being in US interest to avoid open war between India and Pakistan or between Iran and Saudi Arabia, but such tensions need to be kept in view.\nWhen it comes to the South China Sea, here's part of his description of its history:\nAt the present, the South China Sea is an area of rising tensions, as China builds artificial islands (which he describes as being basically like permanent aircraft carriers) to assert its claims and project its power.\nAdmiral Stavridis makes reference to the strategic thinking of Alfred Thayer Mahan:\nBased on this rubric, here are some of the recommendations he makes:\nSuch exercises are taking place, as you'll see below. When it comes to the South China Sea, he has a wishlist of bases for the US Navy:\nHis recommendations also include finding areas of common interest for strategic cooperation, even with geopolitical rivals. The premiere example of this was the mission (which he had a prominent role in) to combat Somali piracy. Overfishing (a topic I've visited before) is another issue where international cooperation could be fruitful.\nAn increasingly important piece of infrastructure is subsea cables, and the Admiral sees them as something navies might be called on to defend more in the future.\nBefore I leave Sea Power behind, I wanted to share this quote about Adm. Stavridis' impressions of a major increase in ocean traffic:\nKaplan's book is entirely within the geographic scope of this post, so I'll spend more time on it than I did on Stavridis' (who even recommended Monsoon). It generally gives a big picture view of Asian geopolitics in the 21st century; although the focus is on the Indian Ocean and the adjoining Indonesian archipelago, enough strategic threads cross this theatre to even tie-in some issues related to land-locked Central Asia. Since Monsoon was published 10 years ago, enough time has passed to provide some initial commentary on how well Kaplan's predictions and analysis has held up, so that will be a major aspect to my review.\nMonsoon starts in Oman and proceeds roughly clockwise around the Indian Ocean. The locations Kaplan visits include some in Pakistan and India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma/Myanmar, Indonesia, and Tanzania. In the following paragraphs, I'll note some interesting things I learned, along with follow-up on how things have unfolded over the past decade.\nKaplan describes Oman as being in tension between the cosmopolitan influence of being located by the ocean and tribal influences from the desert:\nIts ruler, Sultan Qaboos (who passed away a year ago) is described as an authoritarian but who achieved a lot of development for his country (comparison is made to Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew) and who maintained stability in a volatile region. He was also apparently a capable diplomat.\nStarting with Oman gave Kaplan a chance to go over some of the history of the Indian Ocean region, since its merchant community has a long history of operating across the basin and beyond. Most of this was things I was already familiar with from the books I read in Part 1 of this series. In the modern age, Oman has capitalized on its position (outside the Strait of Hormuz, so less vulnerable to traffic bottlenecks or a blockade compared to ports in the Gulf like Dubai) to offer a major transshipment hub at Salalah.\nNeighbouring Yemen has been much less successful than Oman, unfortunately. In 2010, Kaplan called it,\nIn the past decade, the erstwhile president-for-life was pressured to leave during the Arab Spring protests. Negotiations between different factions to establish a new constitutional order eventually failed and a civil war has been ongoing for the past six years.\nThere were some random facts about Yemen and Oman that I found interesting. One was the mention of falaj irrigation structures. Another was the links from eastern Yemen to other parts of the Indian Ocean world:\nThese links included Hadhramis serving as bodyguards to the Nizam of Hyderabad.\nElsewhere in the Middle East, Kaplan had some comments about Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia that I feel have held up pretty well over the past decade:\nThe Indian Ocean has two main sub-basins: the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. In Kaplan's view, each of them is topped with a volatile \"pivot state\" (Pakistan and Burma) whose trajectory will have significant geopolitical implications. Something that stood out to me was the palpable difference (in his telling) between regions in India and adjacent regions across the border. For example, here is his description of Kolkata (which is far from being the most prosperous or developped area of India):\nAll of the countries in this region have continued to develop over the past decade, though. Pakistan had the lowest growth rate, and even its GDP has doubled over the past fifteen years (see these trends, and also these ones on declining infant mortality). In Pakistan, Kaplan visited the states of Baluchistan (sparsely populated relative to the rest of the country, but it contains a lot of mineral and energy resources) and Sindh. Both of these have separatist movements (one Sindhi activist accused the upriver Punjab state of taking too much water from the Indus river before it gets to them, for example); he sees national cohesion as a significant challenge for Pakistan in the future.\nAfter the chapter on Sindh, Monsoon crosses the border to the Indian state of Gujarat. It's another case of contrasting impressions:\nModi of course is now the Prime Minister of India, but at the time Monsoon was written he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. One of the places where I think Kaplan's journalistic instincts were spot-on was the fact that the book includes an interview with Modi, despite the fact that he was only a state-level politician at the time and despite not featuring too many other interviews (or just as a short quote, rather than a recap of a whole conversation). The picture that emerges is of a leader with nationalistic tendencies who is also a tireless and competent administrator.\nHe was in charge during the outbreak of religious violence in mass riots in 2002 (his level of responsibility for them is debated in the chapter).\nWhile the attention paid to Modi shows foresight given his rise to the highest office in India, Kaplan expressed the opinion that more moderate politics would likely continue on the national level there. In fact, in the decade since Monsoon was written both India and (as we'll see below) China have gotten more assertive and confrontational leaders, with a resultant hardening of national positions. The recent clashes in the Himalayas come to mind. Additionally, a naval exercise between India, Japan, Australia, Singapore, and the US that Kaplan mentions was repeated last year.\nI'm very interested in issues of water and energy. So I paid close attention to what Kaplan predicted about trends in India around these resources.\nThis has happened already (the list at the link is for consumption, but India is also third for imports, and the US is behind China by that metric). When it comes to coal, however, I'm less certain he got it right:\nAccording to this article, India's use of coal for power generation decreased in 2019 (so too early to be due to the pandemic). It will be interesting to watch this trend. The use of coal appears to be becoming less economically competitive and a decrease in demand in a energy-hungry emerging economy would be a strong confirmation of that.\nWhen it comes to water, Kaplan lists its abundance as a point in Kolkata's favour:\nWhile fresh water is absolutely an invaluable resource, a vibrant economy can also enable lots of measures to mitigate or overcome water shortages. Chennai is a water-stressed city in India but it is in a state with a 77% higher per-capita GDP than Kolkata; some of the initiatives they have to deal with water shortages were featured in a documentary I watched last year. I wouldn't bet on Kolkata leaping past Chennai simply on the basis of having more fresh water available.\nBurma is in a position where historic Indian and Chinese spheres of influence overlap.  Its geography also makes it attractive as an outlet to the sea from southwestern China (Yunnan province). Indeed there have been pipelines and a railway constructed. Within Burma, from Monsoon I gather that its layout comprises hill tribes in horseshoe around the central Irrawaddy valley where the majority ethnic Burman live. The hill regions have harboured insurgents and been a major nexus of the global drug trade.\nWhen Monsoon was written, the military junta was still fully in charge of Burma. That is no longer the case (since 2011), but the above prediction that democracy would be far from a panacea has held up well. Ironically, next door Thailand was a democracy at the time Kaplan was writing but had a coup in 2014, shortly after the Burmese military loosened its grip on power.\nAlthough China doesn't directly border the Indian Ocean, it has a lot of interests and influence there. The Strait of Malacca has at least as much importance to China as the Panama Canal has to the United States, due to its reliance on oil and gas imports from the Middle East (note that energy exports from Western Canada to Asia would not face this bottleneck). I thought it was valuable how Kaplan presented the Chinese perspective of being boxed in along their coastline:\nThere are several ways mentioned in Monsoon that China could try to lessen this maritime vulnerability: extending a measure of influence over archipelagos like the Philippines and Indonesia, creating a route through/over the Isthmus of Kra (whether a canal, land bridge, or pipelines + terminals), overland infrastructure into western China (i.e. through Burma, Pakistan, or directly from the gas fields of Central Asia), and a network of friendly ports or naval bases across the Indian Ocean.\nAt the time of writing, Hu Jintao had the String of Pearls strategy; under Xi Jinping there is the Belt and Road initiative with a larger scope. Kaplan visited a few ports that fit into this strategy and had received Chinese investment: Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, and Kyaupkyu in Burma/Myanmar. I checked their traffic on MarineTraffic for the period of Nov 26 - Dec 9 and they had 8, 47, and 4 arrivals respectively. The ongoing pandemic may have contributed to them being not very busy, but for comparison the Canadian ports of Saint John and Halifax had 121 and 163 arrivals, respectively, during the same period.\nIt needs to be emphasized that, like Admiral Stavridis, Kaplan sees many avenues for cooperation with China (he also mentions fighting piracy). This excerpt gives his nuanced view of the way things could unfold on the seas of Asia:\nThe Indian Ocean touches on Africa as well as Asia, and Kaplan doesn't ignore that continent:\nTo wrap up my review of Monsoon, here's what Kaplan foresees for the monsoon seas in the 21st century:\nFinally, I have just a few more interesting (hopefully!) things to share on this topic:\nThis article also covers the strategic geography of maritime Asia:\nInvestor Ray Dalio is expecting a shift to Asia in terms of imperial prominence.\nHere is a timelapse video of a container ship crossing through these waters from the Red Sea to Hong Kong. Note how crowded things get around Singapore and Hong Kong:\nThe following screenshot (source) shows the winds of the winter monsoon (roughly from the northeast) on December 9, 2020:\nAnd here's a final quote from Kaplan's book to go with it:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is the first part of a two-part series I have planned. It is about the history of trade on the western Indian Ocean and is based on reviews of a couple of books I read this year. Part two will look forward at possible developments in that region.\nThe books I'll be discussing here are Ocean of Trade by Pedro Machado and A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World by William Bernstein. Rather than go over them one at a time, I'll be structuring this post thematically. It will start with a brief introduction to each book, then outline the geography and history of the western Indian Ocean. After that, I'll look at what it was like for merchants and trade goods to sail across it, at some institutional factors that promoted trade, and finally at some miscellaneous topics of interest.\nOcean of Trade covers a narrow window of time from approximately 1750-1850. It is also narrow in its geographical scope, focusing on trade between Diu in India and Mozambique in Africa (both of these were Portuguese colonies at the time). It comprises five chapters: the first two talk about how this trade was conducted, with regard to both business operations and actually crossing the ocean, then the final three focus on the preeminent commodities of textiles, ivory, and slaves. Textiles were particularly important as they were a medium of exchange in southeastern Africa, and Machado emphasizes that consumer demand from Africans was an under-appreciated driver of trade during this era.\nA Splendid Exchange is much broader in its scope, as it attempts to cover the overall history of international trade. It provides a very good longitudinal overview of its subject but of course can't go into the same level of detail as Ocean of Trade for any particular era. I found that it covered a lot of the same ground as The Ascent of Money and Sea & Civilization while having enough new material to keep me interested. While this book doesn't explicitly focus on the Indian Ocean, several key historical trade axes passed through that region, so it does get a lot of attention. As you'll see in the historical overview I share below, trade in the Indian Ocean has ebbed and flowed not just from improvements in technology, but according to global stability. As Bernstein writes,\nOne of the most salient features of the Indian Ocean is the monsoon winds. They are steady and predictable, and blow in opposite directions in the summer and winter. This makes them very well suited for sailing. Here are how Bernstein and Machado, respectively, describe them:\nAnd,\nBasically, the prevailing winds in that part of the ocean come from the southwest in the summer and from the northeast in the winter. In addition to the monsoon winds, the strong west-to-east winds along the southern edge of the Indian Ocean (the \"Roaring Forties\") were also eventually useful to sailors as Bernstein notes:\nOther than the winds that provided historical sailors the means of getting around the Indian Ocean, its geography is also defined by its entry points. The most significant ones are rounding the Cape of Good Hope (from the Atlantic Ocean), the Bab El Mandeb (from the Red Sea, which provided access to the Mediterranean as well as the Hajj to Mecca), the Hormuz Strait (from the Persian Gulf, which connected with overland East-West routes through Baghdad), and the Malacca Strait (from the South China Sea and the Indonesian archipelago). There's also the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java; the preferred route of Dutch sailors was to use the \"roaring forties\" as a shortcut from the Cape of Good Hope to the Sunda Strait, where they set up Batavia (modern Jakarta) as the fulcrum of their trade in Asia. The Torres Strait into the South Pacific doesn't seem like it was relevant during the historical period considered in this post.\nAs mentioned, A Splendid Exchange provides a broad historical overview of international trade.  I'll briefly summarize it here; the Indian Ocean is quite central in this history as it provided a water route between East and West. Bernstein refers to the \"earliest axis of trade\" as stretching out from Mesopotamia to Anatolia (the core of modern Turkey) in one direction and through the Gulf and along the coast to the Indus River valley in the other direction. As time progressed, the axis of trade across the Indian Ocean lengthened, with goods passing between Europe or the Middle East and East Asia during eras when there were stable empires at each end. For example, there was trade between the Roman Empire and Han dynasty China, and between the Abbasid Caliphate and Tang dynasty China. Keep in mind that it would have been rare for any individual to travel the whole distance (although Bernstein mentions a Roman trade colony in the vicinity of Pondicherry), rather, goods (silk, for example, was a luxury good in ancient Rome) would migrate from one entrepôt to another along gradients of demand.\nKeeping in mind the entry points to the Indian Ocean discussed above, there were three popular East-West routes utilized in classical and medieval times. One went through Mesopotamia and the Gulf. Another went via the Red Sea (which was much more challenging to navigate due to shallows and contrary winds); Alexandria and Cairo benefitted greatly from this trade. Additionally, there was the overland route (i.e. the Silk Road—not really a single road but a network of oases, caravanserais, and mountain passes; a camel can carry around a third of a ton 30+ miles per day and can last 3 days without water, so rest spots were needed every 100 miles or so). This was especially the case when the Mongolian khans had brought Central Asia under unified political control; at other times travel by sea was easier. (This window of relatively easy land travel across Central Asia is also when the Black Plague spread. It reached the Genoese-controlled port of Kaffa—which had a big slave market that provided a lot of the Mamluk soldiers—on the Black Sea during a Mongol siege in the 1340s and from there quickly reached ports throughout the Mediterranean.).\nFor centuries, these three routes were all under Muslim control. Bernstein writes that,\nThe European age of exploration was largely motivated by trying to get around this Islamic monopoly. A breakthrough came when Vasco da Gama reached the Indian Ocean by the other western entrance: rounding the southern cape of Africa. Something I learned from A Splendid Exchange was that da Gama had a good idea of where he was going (a quote I share below cites his navigational accuracy, with the assistance of a pilot acquired in East Africa), probably because earlier Portuguese travellers had visited various ports in the Indian Ocean (via the other routes) and written about them. An interesting what-if raised by Bernstein is that China had briefly made a show of naval force in the Indian Ocean only sixty-five years before da Gama's voyage. History might have gone very differently if Portuguese and Chinese fleets had encountered each other.\nAs it turned out, Portugal was able to establish forts at critical harbours and choke points and win some naval engagements such as the Battle of Diu against an allied force of the Egyptian Mamluks and some Indian monarchies. In spite of their small population, they were thus able to establish a measure of control over trade in the Indian Ocean. They were succeeded by the Dutch and then the British, and A Splendid Exchange spends a lot of time talking about the East India Companies of those two nations. To round out this historical outline, here's how Ocean of Trade describes its more focused setting in what remained of Portugal's Indian Ocean colonies by the time the British were in the ascendancy:\nThis is a good reminder that even during European colonialism local communities in the Indian Ocean continued to have a large role and presence in trade there. The first Indian to receive a British knighthood was a trader from Bombay while it was governed by the East India Company, for example.\nMoving on from the historical and geographical background, I'll spend a little time on ships and sailing on the monsoon seas. According to Machado, voyages from Mozambique to India (he says 3-5 ships per year plied this route out of Diu and Daman in the second half of the 1700s) lasted about a month at the start of the 19th century. Using the distance from this screenshot from Google Maps, that works out to an average speed of around 7 km/h (3.8 knots since 1 NM = 1.85 km).\nVasco da Gama crossed a narrower stretch of ocean (Kenya to Kerala) at about the same speed:\nMost of the ships used by local trading communities in the Indian Ocean were some variety of dhow. Here's how Machado describes the ships used by the traders he writes about:\nIt does seem that the caravel ships that the Portuguese used had some advantages over dhows in maneuverability. As more centuries passed, ship technology continued to improve. Clipper ships (such as the Cutty Sark) could exceed 15 knots. Although still powered by the wind, they were no longer bound to the seasonal rhythms of the monsoons since they were able to tack into the prevailing winds. For this reason, they were widely used in tea/opium runs to Canton and Hong Kong in the Pearl River Delta region of China. Bernstein notes that clipper ships continued to be used even after steam power was available because they had an advantage on long routes (since they weren't limited by the need to refuel on coal). However, once the Suez Canal opened in 1869 (cutting the distance between London and Bombay almost in half), steam power had the definite economic advantage. Machado also notes how changing technology marked an end to the traditional Indian Ocean trading system based on the monsoon winds:\n(He also mentions competition from machine-made American textiles as a factor that drove disruption).\nFor a glimpse into that traditional system, A Splendid Exchange refers to medieval travel literature. From the tales of Sinbad to the writings of actual travellers like Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo, these accounts give a sense of what travel and trade was like then. Another account that Bernstein refers to is 'أخبار الصين والهند' from around 850 A.D. The crossing times that it provides for a journey between the Middle East and China are one month from Oman to the Malabar Coast, one month to cross the Bay of Bengal, 20 days around the Malay peninsula through the strait of Malacca, and one month to Canton. But due to the need to wait for the appropriate seasonal directions of the prevailing wind for each stage, the journey would have taken over a year in total. And a long distance journey like that would also typically involve changing boats multiple times:\nBoth of the books that are the subject of this post are about trade. One theme that I found interesting from them was about governance/institutional factors that could promote or stifle trade. Machado emphasizes the importance of trust between merchants:\nHe feels that the merchants in Diu that he's writing about had some advantages when it came to maintaining trust. They had their traditional local institutions (mahajan) for arbitration but as a Portuguese colony they also had recourse to colonial legal institutions for dispute resolution. Confidence in the rule of law is good for building trust. Their trade generated a lot of customs revenue for the Portuguese authorities, so their needs and interests weren't something the governor or judge could ignore.\nAnother service that these merchants from Diu and Daman obtained from the colonial authorities was having one vessel per year designated (as a \"barco de viagem\") for naval escort and other privileges/protections.\nIn his book, Bernstein considers the governance and institutional factors (such as predictable and non-onerous taxes/duties and the rule of law) that led to the flourishing of the Sultanate of Malacca:\nAnother governance factor that gets discussed in A Splendid Exchange is the different approach to human resources between the Dutch and English East India Companies:\nDespite the earlier start and better financing of the Dutch VOC, it was eventually eclipsed by the English EIC.\nIvory was a major commodity covered in Ocean of Trade. I wanted to include some discussion of that trade in this post, since it was also mentioned in another book I reviewed this year, Harvesting the Biosphere:\nThe numbers in Machado's book are significantly higher. He says that some years (in the late 1700s or early 1800s) the merchants he's writing about (on one route, compared to the global trade in the excerpt above) traded more than 300 tonnes of ivory. That represents over 3,000 elephants (assuming up to 50 kg per tusk—it's lower now). Assuming around 15 million African elephants in the late 18th century, this would be around 1% of the number that would die of natural causes in a given year (at a 50 - 60 year lifespan); however, Mozambique and the trade routes that fed into it only covered a portion of east Africa. I don't know which estimate of the historical ivory trade is more accurate.\nYemen is a country I find kind of fascinating and have written about before. So I was interested in mentions of its history in these books. While the northern end (e.g. Alexandria) of the Red Sea route in and out of the Indian Ocean was much more prosperous than the southern end, there was often a port in Yemen that hosted some of this exchange such as Socotra, Mocha, or Aden. When the Portuguese empire was at its zenith, they failed to gain control of the entrance to the Red Sea (the Bab el Mandeb) so it remained open to competing traders. While Yemen was under Ottoman control for a period of time, it gained independence in the 1630s. Mocha was a thriving port in this era (and, yes, coffee was one of its exports). However, Machado writes that the tolerance for foreign merchants that trade depends had a shaky foundation:\nSimilar things happened elsewhere, too. Bernstein writes about the twilight years of the Tang dynasty:\nTo close off this post, here's an old map I found of the Indian Ocean in 1940 (it's at least a century later than Ocean of Trade and also later than all but the last two chapters of A Splendid Exchange but it still shows a lot of the key ports mentioned) and a quote (from Bernstein's book) about the monsoon legacy:\nPermalink",

    "content": "In this post, I wanted to share a project I did this year: building a kayak paddle.\nThe paddle I built is more-or-less in the Greenland style. I adapted the instructions/dimensions from here. Here is a summary of the steps I followed:\nThe use of white cedar keeps it light, while the oak adds strength in critical places. The paddle is 207 cm long and the blades are 8.5 cm wide.  The shaft is longer than suggested by the instructions I looked at, but part of the point of building your own paddle is to make something that feels comfortable. I've used it a couple of times so far and it works well.\nHere are some photos of the paddle under construction and once it was finished (next to my back door for scale).\nI've previously seen Greenland-style kayak paddles at the National Museum in Denmark (the bags are used for flotation to avoid losing them):\nAnother DIY project I've done recently is converting an antique dresser (from my grandparents' farmhouse) into storage shelves (for board games). It involved adding shelves into the empty spaces left when the drawers were removed; eventually I want to use the wood and handles from the drawers to build a couple of doors for the front, but for now I'll leave it as open shelves.\nThere's been enough negative news this year, so I thought I'd end this post with a brief discussion of a documentary I watched this spring that highlighted positive stories about solutions to water challenges that people around the world are implementing. The documentary is called Brave Blue World and has a runtime slightly less than an hour. It's main weakness was that the short length didn't leave much time for details on the initiatives they covered, but it's certainly worth watching if you have the opportunity. Here's a short list of stories from the documentary that I thought were neat:\nIn general, water recycling of all sorts was a major theme of this documentary. It also included the statement that there is,\nWater reuse and energy recovery are important themes in my profession, and I thought Brave Blue World did a good job conveying that.\nPermalink",

    "content": "These ideas have been percolating for a while. I'm getting around to writing them up now because the Coronavirus situation has really shown the value in carrying a margin in good times. Also, at the bottom of the post you can find some links on the topic of what's next as many places are coming out of lockdowns.\nThe concept of slack, in the sense I'll be using it herein, can be found in this post (and also check out this one):\nBeing a slacker normally carries bad connotations, but the linked post reframes the issue:\nOnly by having a margin (of time, money, energy, concentration, etc.) that is surplus and unspoken for in the good times will there be extra to give in lean times (consider Pharaoh's dream of seven ample cows and seven scrawny ones)—or when a really good opportunity comes along.\nProfit is surplus revenue left over after expenses are paid. Certain categories of expenses (e.g. taxes or depreciation) may sometimes be included or excluded from the calculation; profit can be expressed as a percentage of revenue or of the capital (investments and/or loans) tied up in its generation. Profit is viewed with suspicion in some quarters, but I think the present crisis shows its importance. A business that simply aimed to break even in normal times would have no slack available for times that aren't normal. A type of trigger for abnormal times is \"Black swan\" events, which are unexpected yet have an impact that drastically exceeds normal events. An investment fund advised by Nassim Taleb, the author who popularized the concept, did pretty well when the Coronavirus crisis started. Another concept Taleb has promoted is \"skin in the game\"—when there's something riding on your decisions, you'll get filtered out if you don't make good ones. Making a profit (normally) is how entities with skin in the game survive.\nDuring the Coronavirus crisis, a lot of businesses have stepped up and responded in beneficial ways:\nI can also think of other examples, from Amazon helping to keep supply chains going, to local breweries making hand sanitizer. And lots of employers have taken action to keep essential services going safely (e.g. rapidly putting up plexiglass shields at grocery store check outs) while letting employees who can work from home. I've been impressed by the planning and communication from my own employer over the past few months, for example.\nOutside of times of crisis, profitable companies are more likely to have the slack to engage in R&D. Bell Labs in its heyday contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies, including encryption, lasers, digital cameras, and widely-used operating systems and programming languages. Many Google products arose from encouraging their employees to devote 20% of their time to side projects. Peter Thiel's ideas on monopolies are probably relevant here, since they can maintain enough slack to have these kinds of programs.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, I've got some links to share related to the post-pandemic recovery and other thoughts on what's next. I don't necessarily agree with every single one, but think they're good for stimulating thought and discussion.\nFinally, I want to revisit the topic of universal basic income, since the income support programs introduced during the pandemic might shed some light on its potential costs.\nCanada's Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) costed out a guaranteed basic income (GBI) for a six month period starting in October 2020. Note that it isn't a full UBI: it is only for adults 18 - 64. Their report puts an estimate of $72B gross cost for a 6-month GBI (in the intermediate scenario they show), with offsetting measures (cancelling redundant support programs) of $15B available. This gives an annual net cost of $114B, around a third of the federal budget (~$350B) in a normal year (this year, the deficit alone is trending to be as much as total expenditures were last year). For comparison, this is around double what is currently spent on elderly benefits. The details of their plan is a payment that starts at 75% of Low-Income Measure (so around $1,500/month for an individual or $2,100/month for a couple) and 25% (in the intermediate scenario) is clawed back for each dollar of employment income—this is not counted as a new tax, but might feel like one from some perspectives (for comparison, the current federal marginal tax rate on first tier of income is 15%). Around 16 million people would receive GBI payments under this scenario, with the average recipient getting $745 per month after clawbacks. Because this plan doesn't include children or seniors, the offsetting savings don't get rid of the Canada Child Benefit or Old Age Security either. Lots of people are out of work due to the pandemic and related restrictions, but as far as I can tell, the report doesn't assume any additional people quitting their jobs due to the GBI. In summary, the PBO's analysis shows that the cost of a fairly modest, not-truly-universal, basic income would be a significant increase (around 32%) to the federal budget.\nI also recently saw this analysis costing out a UBI in the UK. It is based on replacing income taxes and national insurance with a 47% flat tax, then giving everyone £8,000 ($13,600 CAD) annually as a UBI. It is intended as an argument in favour, but the cost it comes up with strikes me as politically unpalatable (but agree or disagree, I certainly appreciate that they took the time and effort to work through some numbers). Specifically, middle class voters will end up worse off. The tax brackets of £30,000 - £50,000 ($51,000 - $85,000 CAD) and higher will end up contributing more taxes on net with the UBI than before. Only the middle class provides a large enough tax base to support a UBI, but making them worse off is not generally a good path to [re-]election.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a rambling review of a couple of books and a technical paper that are all around a common theme of obtaining renewable resources from photosynthesis.\nThe books I'll be covering in this post are Harvesting the Biosphere by Vaclav Smil and Slime by Ruth Kassinger. It's my goal to not just provide a summary but to really engage with the content, as the themes are of interest to me on both a personal and professional level.\nI read Smil's book at the end of 2019 (as part of this challenge). The first thing I'll say about it is that it is very quantitative. It starts off with a chapter on units and definitions, which is good for ensuring readers are all on the same page, but if you're someone that needs more than a refresher on gigatonnes and terawatts, then it should be taken as fair warning that the whole tome will probably be a slog. Personally, I like that kind of thing; one feature of the book that I appreciated were some boxes that were interspersed with worked-out calculations of different biomass productivities and harvests, starting from clearly explained assumptions. From that starting point, Smil goes through efforts to quantify first the biosphere, then humans' extractions from it. Harvesting the Biosphere covers biomass inventories (stores), productivities (fluxes), harvests of plant and animal biomass, indirect human impacts on the biosphere (through land uses changes, etc.), and the history of foraging and agriculture. Finally, Smil attempts to add up the total human demand on the biosphere, and considers possible future trends.\nWhat does it mean to harvest biomass? Smil talks about \"Food, feed, fiber, and wood\" (personally I'd go for alliteration as food, feed, fuel, and fibre, since cellulose is a key ingredient in both cotton and lumber) as the key categories of the uses to which people put plants. \"Feed\" refers to plants used to nourish domesticated livestock; from the big picture view of global ecology taken in Harvesting the Biosphere, eating animals is like eating plants with extra steps. The organic matter that goes to all of these uses originates from organisms that can fix atmospheric inorganic carbon by capturing energy from the sun:\nAlthough we put biomass to diverse uses,\nIn most cases, we're interested in properties like the energy content—either as food/feed or fuel (and Smil often reports quantities as an energy equivalent)—the protein content, or structural building blocks (in the case of lumber and fibrous plants). Applications where a specific organic substance (e.g. ivory or natural pigments for dyes) is sought are more niche and generally don't involve large enough quantities to get much focus in a broad book like this.\nOne of the strengths of Smil's book is that he doesn't just present the overall amounts of biomass inventories, annual yield, or harvested by humans, but dives into where they come from and the limitations/uncertainties of the underlying studies. However, to keep this review to a manageable length, I will jump into the totals without any more preamble, then get into some of the random details I found especially interesting.\nThe first grand total to consider is the overall inventory of biomass in the world. Obviously this can't be measured directly, so various estimates have been made:\nFrom his review, Smil thinks a range of 500 - 800 gigatonnes as carbon (midpoint = 650 Gt C) is reasonable. This is the same order of magnitude as carbon in the atmosphere, which is 830 Gt C (at 390 ppm CO2). I wonder if biosphere and atmosphere carbon levels tend to stay in a rough equilibrium?\nThere are similar uncertainties when it comes to the total annual yield of biomass:\nNet primary productivity (NPP) is the one he makes the most use of in Harvesting the Biosphere.  Gross primary productivity is the amount of energy captured by photosynthesizers from the sun; NPP is calculated by subtracting their metabolic needs to arrive at the total they can put towards growth. Here are the estimates for NPP:\nTaking the middle of the ranges stated gives an estimated global NPP of 105 gigatonnes per year as carbon, split almost equally between the land and water (54 Gt C/yr and 51 Gt C/yr, respectively). However, the surface area of water is 2.4 times higher (36 vs 15 gigahectares), so the productivity on land is higher. I'll discuss this more below. Comparing the biomass stores and flux yields an average turn-over time of around 6 years. Smil uses some rough equivalence factors—which is all that can be done in such a zoomed-out analysis—to estimate the dry weight of phytomass to be double the mass as carbon (the live/wet weight will be higher still, but water content varies widely) and the energy content to be 20 gigajoules per dry tonne.  I did some calculations on cellulose (C6H10O5, the most abundant biopolymer) for comparison to these factors: it is 44% carbon by mass, with an energy density of 17 GJ/t.\nThe capture of solar energy is calculated as 1.1 x 1014 watts. Solar irradiance is around 1 kW per m2 but once night and clouds are accounted for, it's more like 200 W/m2 (see this image for reference); multiplying by a global surface area of 5.1 x 1014 m2 indicates 0.1% of incoming solar energy is converted into biomass. This fraction is a consequence of the efficiency of photosynthesis and global coverage of plants and other photosynthesizers. Going to higher trophic levels (herbivores then carnivores), only around 10% of energy consumed can be converted into new biomass. To put the amount of energy involved in further context, the US uses around 0.1 ZJ (100 quadrillion BTU) annually, compared to the 3.5 ZJ Smil states.\nThe theme of this book, of course, is not just the biosphere but also how much of its productivity is captured by humanity. Out of NPP, significant amounts of phytomass are consumed by animals or fungi, or comprise roots and other parts of plants that we don't find readily usable.  And some phytomass is used as feed for livestock rather than directly as food, with the energy conversion losses that implies. There are different ways of looking at the amount of biosphere productivity that humans end up claiming. All of them come with the caveat that,\nDifferent values from different studies are presented in the book. One of them is:\nIn another place Smil states that crops consumed by people or our livestock (plus the residues from processing them) add up to around 2.6 Gt C/yr. Phytomass is also consumed for energy, land clearance, and by wildfires started by people. Another way of looking at humanity's claim on the biosphere is the footprint of agriculture:\nThe totals above encompass a lot of variability. When it comes to the stores of phytomass in different biomes, temperate grasslands have 10-20 dry tonnes per hectare, wetlands have 20-60, and boreal forests have 40-100. The timeframe in which this biomass undergoes a turn-over also varies widely. Peak net annual productivity (in the Amazon and Southeast Asia) is around 10 tonnes per hectare as carbon (around 20 tonnes per hectare dry weight and 400 GJ/ha using Smil's back-of-the-envelope conversions). The poles, deserts, and nutrient-poor areas of the open ocean will be far less, of course.\nHaving reviewed the big picture view that is the core of Harvesting the Biosphere, I want to share some other things it covered that I found interesting, including biomass used for energy or grazing.\nBrazilian sugarcane has the highest yield of any crop, at 75 tonnes/hectare (fresh weight, of which around 12% is sucrose). The output from a hectare can be converted into around 5,000 litres of ethanol. Corn yields have increased dramatically over the past century but are not as high (10 tonnes per hectare) and thus the ethanol output per hectare is also lower.\nIn previous times (and still in some places), woody biomass was a major source of energy. One of the calculation boxes I mentioned above goes into the amount of charcoal that would have been consumed by a blast furnace in the eighteenth century for smelting pig iron. A single furnace could go through 12,000 tonnes of wood to smelt 300 tonnes of metal. Although efficiencies have improved since then, it's very good for the world's forests that non-biomass sources of energy have been found:\nAnd that's just the energy demand of smelting. Another calculation box considers the amount of wood that went into large sailing ships at their zenith (4,000 tonnes, plus 2,000 tonnes trimmed off in the construction process) and states that it could have provided the annual heating needs of 1,500 households. When wood was the main source for household and industrial energy needs in addition to being the primary building material, it was consumed at a prodigious rate. From this historical perspective, Smil is not highly enthusiastic about biofuels being a sustainable source of energy. He also points out that even cellulosic ethanol, which would use crop residues rather than food crops, would still be competing for phytomass that currently serves for animal fodder or helps maintain and regenerate soil.\nOne of the conclusions I drew from Harvesting the Biosphere is that in Smil's judgement, it's better not to rely on the biosphere for our energy needs (so a mix of nuclear power and renewables would probably be the most viable route to reduce dependency on fossil fuels). Hopefully it can continue to be enough for our other needs of food, feed, and fibre.\nSome of the statistics and discussion around grazing were interesting. Smil reports that in Masai Mara National Park in Kenya the live weight of large wild mammals works out to 100 kg/ha. A calculation box about grazing cattle (also in East Africa) has densities that work out to 25 kg/ha (around 10 hectares per cow), with each cow consuming 1.5 dry tonnes of grass per year. But grazing shouldn't be seen as just taking from the ecosystem. Grazers (wild and domestic) fertilize grasslands and so contribute to its productivity. Smil writes that,\nCompared to even the most teeming natural ecosystems, the population density of cities is astounding. I'll use a different example than Smil, but he makes the same point. Vancouver is the densest city in Canada (NYC is twice as dense), with 5500 people per square kilometer (probably over 2000 kg/ha). A 2000 Calorie per day diet adds up to 3 GJ/yr, so even the most productive ecosystems can only support 100 - 150 people per hectare—if their food needs are all met from plants, the net primary productivity is fully captured and not shared with other heterotrophs, and non-food needs (fuel, fibre, etc.) are negligible. A lot of ancient civilizations were only at 1% of this density or slightly more. The fact that modern cities can exceed this density by so much is a testament to the far flung hinterlands they effectively rely on, and to the connective logistics.\nMost of this review up to now has focused on the terrestrial biosphere, just as the book does. But it does have a bit to say about the marine biosphere. One of its key features is that most biomass in the oceans is heterotrophs:\n*Elsewhere he provides a citation that phytoplankton has a standing mass of only 1 - 4 gigatonnes as carbon, and a turnover time of 2-6 days. This would seem to imply a higher NPP than the ~50 Gt C/yr quoted above.\nThis means that most of what humanity harvests from the sea is animals (fish, shellfish, etc.). Harvesting higher trophic levels has a multiplier effect in terms of the burden on the primary productivity of the ocean, so overfishing is a concern. I was reminded of a documentary I watched that referred to \"the rise of slime\", where diminished numbers of fish to graze on them leads to an unhealthy proliferation of phytoplankton and invertebrates (another episode of the same documentary talked about the benefits of grazing, as referred to above).\nStill, I think the oceans have a lot of untapped potential, if stewarded in the way on-land agriculture has been to increase yields (and here's an article on how even on-land production of animal feed could be significantly further intensified) and diversifying harvests away from apex species. Seasteading discussed ways to enhance oceanic productivity by inducing upwelling of nutrient-rich water from the seafloor to the sunlit surface, to list one possibility.\nThis discussion of tapping more into marine productivity is a good spot for moving on to Ruth Kassinger's book. I'll start where she does, with a definition of algae:\nCyanobacteria and microalgae are both single-celled phytoplankton, while macroalgae are multicellular and colloquially known as seaweed. The description continues with some characteristics that make the relevance of algae to this post clear:\nSlime is divided into four sections. The first section was like a textbook excerpt, summarizing the current scientific understanding about algae. I found the book got a lot more interesting in subsequent sections where the author started discussing how it has been and continues to be harvested for human use. These sections used a style of writing that I almost always enjoy, where the writer takes readers along on their research journey by describing the places they go and the people they talk to, rather than just sharing their findings. Kassinger certainly went a lot of places: both sides of the Gulf of Maine, South Korea, the British Isles, the southern US. She covers topics such as algae as food products in various cultures; modern cultivation efforts as animal feed, fertilizer, biopolymers, and fuel; and finally environmental issues related to algae. The environmental issues span from negative impacts such as algae blooms and coral bleaching, to possible solutions like water treatment (see below) and even geoengineering. At the back of the book there is an appendix with some suggested recipes for cooking with algae.\nFor my review, I'll focus on the industrial biotechnology stories that Kassinger discusses, as that's an area I have a professional interest in. Although algae have had some industrial uses for a long time⁠—she mentions people in the Orkney Islands going kelping then burning the seaweed to make ash (soda ash and potash; 20,000 tons of ash from 400,000 tons of seaweed) for glassmaking two hundred years ago⁠—it has seen a surge of interest lately. Like any field brimming with optimism, not every venture has been a success. I appreciated the clear-eyed coverage of the sector. The saga of Sapphire Energy stands out as an example:\nAlgenol is another company that attempted to make biofuel (ethanol in this case) from algae:\nWhile they still appear to be around, their website now makes no mention of fuel and instead offers niche products that command a higher margin. As Smil discussed, biofuels are—at least for the present—very difficult to make the numbers pencil out for stand-alone production. The potential upsides mean people will surely continue to try, but anyone who does would be well advised to be able to pivot to a premium product as a back-up plan, as that's what the companies that have survived seem to have done.\nSolazyme (later known as TerraVia) is another company covered in the book. They have gone bankrupt in recent years but their assets were purchased by Corbion, so production of at least some of their products continues. Another very unique product made from algae covered in this book is the renewable plastic (ethylene vinyl acetate) made by Algix and used to make sneakers (in the paper I discuss below they consider sending algae to Algix as a feedstock for bioplastics).\nI feel a slight connection to one of the stories covered in Slime, partly because the company is headquartered in the region where I live, and partly because the company I work for supplied a wastewater treatment system for a carrageenan processing plant in the Philippines.\n*Their current seaweed products include plant growth stimulants and animal feed\nSpeaking of water treatment, Kassinger mentions a floway near Vero Beach, Florida that uses algae to absorb nutrients from stormwater:\nWhile that's certainly not a trivial amount, it only works out to 10 pounds of nitrogen per acre per day (11.5 kg/ha/d). The overall yield is 2000 tonnes/ha/yr of fresh weight, more than 25 times the yield for sugarcane that Smil cites (although the water content is probably significantly higher, so I wish dry weights were given for comparison).\nWhile I haven't yet tried any of the recipes included with the book (or from a website the author recommended; and here's another online guide to cooking with seaweed), Slime did inspire some scones my fiancée made using dulse as one of the ingredients. They were very tasty.\nFinally, I want to briefly discuss a paper I read on using algae for wastewater treatment. \"The potential of nutrient recovery from wastewater using a revolving algae biofilm system and beneficial utilization of algae biomass\" by Kumar et al. (2019) was presented at the WEFTEC conference. Some of the authors are affiliated with Gross-Wen Technologies, which has a \"revolving algal biofilm\" (RAB) technology that the study is based on. The RAB comprises belts for algae to grow on that are partially submerged in water. As they rotate, the algal biofilm is alternately exposed to water, where it can absorb dissolved nutrients and keep from drying out, and air, where it can obtain CO2 (an important nutrient for autotrophs) and receive more light. Part of the study was to attempt to find the right balance between the time in the water and in the air. The belt arrangement also provides more surface area for growth compared to a raceway, reducing the overall footprint of the system.\nPart of the motivation for a system like this is to recover phosphorus in a usable form:\nThey were able to achieve decent removals of nutrients from secondary municipal effluent:\nFor comparison with the books discussed in this post, the productivity of the algal biomass is a good thing to consider. Figure 5 in the paper, based on some modelling they did, shows 3.5 g/m2/d (based on the belt surface area) or 22 g/m2/d (based on the footprint). They are equivalent to 12.8 tonnes/ha/yr and 80 tonnes/ha/yr, respectively (if I understand correctly, these are dry weights); they claim adding supplemental lighting can increase productivity by a factor of ~3.\nThe midpoints of the nutrient content of the algal biomass were 6.3% and 1.8%, for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. For comparison this paper (in table 3) has a similar nitrogen content of 5.1 - 6.3% in different types of algae (and an energy value of 18 - 20.5 MJ/kg, which lines up well with factors Smil used). Combining the nutrient content with the biomass productivity gives a result that a single unit (150 m2 surface area; and assuming no supplemental lighting) could remove around 9 g/d of phosphorus. So the footprint for a full-scale application would be very large.\nTo wrap up this post, I'll share a photo of an exhibit that Micropia (a museum in Amsterdam) had about algae and things that can be made from them:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I like to share interesting links I've collected on a somewhat regular basis. It seemed especially timely when many people could be looking for things to read while stuck at home to slow the spread of COVID-19.\nI won't spend this whole post on current events, but did want to start with some articles on big-picture topics related to the pandemic or what might come next. \"As rare, high-impact events like the coronavirus epidemic reminds us, a densely-networked world may also be more fragile,\" writes Dr. David Shaywitz. He quotes Taleb:\nThe concept of network effects contributing to complexity was a point that came up in some books I reviewed a bit over a year ago. In that post I pointed out, \"the value of circuit breakers/firebreaks in an age when so many things are interconnected\" in the context of not getting sucked in to social media pile-ons, but clearly it's also applicable to public health.\nI've already shared a quote from N.N. Taleb; this post explains his concept of anti-fragility: going beyond robustness (stability in the face of challenges) to actually getting stronger under adversity. He explains how this is true of our immune system, which gains valuable information about threats to our health through exposure (including via vaccines, when available).\nSomething I've been thinking about as schools and workplaces have shut down and people have been encouraged to self isolate is that some families might find that their kids learn as well or better at home than at school, and some employers/employees might find that working from home arrangements can be just as productive as being in an office. This won't be everyone's experience, of course, but for some people their first time trying homeschooling or working remotely will be a success and I expect these things to grow in popularity accordingly. Similar predictions are made here, with the added point that this could enable people in dense urban areas (facing challenges from high housing costs and other issues) to disperse geographically without giving up too much in the way of career opportunities. Dispersing away from dense urban areas may mitigate some of the risks we face in our hyper-networked modern world (e.g. NYC is currently a global hotspot for COVID-19 cases).\nThis article makes the case that cracking down on free speech is a counterproductive approach to fighting a pandemic (or doing most other things).\nThe economic impact of coronavirus-related shutdowns can be seen in the drop in air pollution over places like China and Italy.\nMy previous post noted the budget challenges that New Brunswick was facing even before the pandemic crisis in affording healthcare for an aging population. Some of the people on the front lines of that effort (and not just in NB) are not paid very well. This article examines that topic and draws a comparison to pre-industrial spinning labour due to the sheer amount of hands-on effort that's required:\nIf you're looking for things to do from the comfort of your home, here are a few ideas:\nIf you are—quite reasonably—looking for things unrelated to COVID-19 to read and think about, the rest of this post is for you:\nPermalink",

    "content": "At the time of writing, this budget may or may not pass, due to it being a minority government. Budget approvals are always considered confidence votes, so if it is not approved, expect an election. In any case, I decided to write my annual summary anyway.\nAs per usual, I'll try to keep most of the amounts in millions (M) of dollars (CAD) because I think it's easier to compare than mixing million and billions. And while I'll mostly refer to it as the 2020 budget, it is technically for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. This is probably also a good spot to point out that the provincial government has a handy new dashboard for the New Brunswick economy.\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nThe net debt by the end of the fiscal year will represent around 35% of GDP (assuming the economy stays relatively stable).\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nOne notable change is that the amount that has to be spent on debt service is declining as a result of back-to-back balanced budgets, and now is less than what is spent on colleges and universities (and the other things within that department).\nOn the revenue side of the 2020 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nThe taxes are spread among a number of categories (income, sales, property, corporate income, gas, carbon, tobacco, etc.), so \"Fiscal Equalization Payments\" represents the single largest line item.\nThe following pair of graphs show the budgeted expenditures by department and the budgeted revenue by source. Both of them have the change from how much was budgeted in that category last year noted.\nFor the first figure, there are some small departments such as the Finance and Treasury Board, and the Office of the Premier that I didn't include. Some notable changes from last year's budget include $46M less that needs to be spent on servicing the public debt, increases of around $55M to the departments of Education and Social Development, and increases of over $100M to the departments of Health and General Government. The latter had the largest percentage increase. It is accounted for by the introduction of a climate change investment fund and a natural gas distribution subsidy, along with budgeting for the deployment of ERP software and increased contingency in a \"supplemental funding\" bucket (apparently as an allowance pending the resolution of some collective bargaining agreements).\nFor the second figure, a notable change was separating the carbon tax (included as part of \"Other Taxes\" on the graph) from the gas tax, which explains the changes to those items. I'll also note some proposed reductions in property tax rates, although the revenue from those taxes isn't projected to change; whether due to it being counterbalanced by the expected increase in the size of the tax base, or due to a delay before the changes take effect, I'm not sure.\nEqualization payments increased by $187M over what was budgeted last year. This is because NB is the most \"have-not\" province in Canada. The posted budget surplus would not have been possible without this increase. I think it is wise to put the increased equalization payments toward paying down the provincial debt (and thus freeing up money that otherwise would have had to go to interest payments in future years) because I'm not sure they can be counted on to stay at their current level for too long. If the recent drop in oil prices holds, the economies of \"have\" provinces like Alberta could suffer—at a time when resentment against being on the paying end is already growing:\nThis excerpt is from a manifesto that is unlikely to be implemented as-is (at least in my opinion). But the sentiment behind it is likely to be part of the national conversation in the years ahead. An adjustment to the Equalization formula may thus become a political necessity for the federal government; any adjustment is unlikely to benefit New Brunswick so being in a flexible fiscal position to deal with diminished revenue from this source would be prudent.\nDavid Campbell had an eye-opening post about the demographics of NB a bit over a year ago:\nIt included this graph, which I've reshared for discussion purposes:\nWhile the decline in the youth population appears to have been arrested for now, the growing population of seniors is likely to be a key factor in the economy and politics of the province for years to come.\nAnother way of looking at this topic is through the \"Dependency Ratio\" statistics kept by Stats Canada. They define this as the number of people too young or too old to be in the main bracket of the workforce (i.e. less than 20 or 65+) per 100 people in the working age population. As of 2018 (the most recent year with available data), this was 68.1 in NB compared to 63.8 in Canada as a whole. As this ratio increases, there are fewer people in the working age population to support students and retirees.\nWhen you also look at stats like the labour force participation rate and unemployment rate (61.1% and 6.9%, respectively), the number of people employed in New Brunswick is only 46% of the population (381,000 / 780,000).\nPutting these trends together means that services such as health care (and nursing homes, which account for $367M of the Social Development budget) that are especially needed by the elderly are likely to see steadily increasing demand without a corresponding boost to the capacity to fund them (the Dept. of Health budget has increased by 11% in the past five years by my calculations, so it's not like it is being neglected). Indeed, hospitals and nursing homes have been the focus of political disputes recently. At the same time, it could get politically easier to say \"not in my backyard\" to projects that could generate new jobs, since people that need jobs are in the minority. I see this as a recipe for inter-generational conflict. For example, it would be easy for seniors to think that they worked hard all their lives and now services they were counting on are strained or have limited availability; meanwhile, younger generations might feel that they've got an unfair load to bear as a result of the dependency ratio getting into uncharted territory.\nThat's not the future I want for NB (however we got here, let's recognize that we're in this boat together), so I'll finish this post by pointing out the hopeful and ambitious plan outlined in the state of the province address:\nThe goal of these measures—and I'd add let's try having more kids here too—is to reach a population of 1 million people in 2040.\nPermalink",

    "content": "It's hard to believe we're already a month into 2020. This post looks back at something I built as a Christmas gift for some kids.\nBottle rockets are a fun toy. Unlike most rockets, they don't rely on combustion. This makes them safer to play with, and also means that the materials used don't need to stand up to high heat, just moisture and moderate pressures—used pop bottles work great. The conventional style uses water and compressed air (although there are other combinations like pop + butane). The compressed air provides the energy and the water gives it something to push against. Recall that Newton's Third Law states that every action has an equal an opposite reaction: all rockets need something for a \"reaction mass\" (although if combustion is involved it is usually just the exhaust gases rather than adding an extra substance).\nLike I said in the introduction, I built a bottle rocket launcher as a Christmas gift. Here's a picture of it in action:\nHere's a look at the launcher and its components. It comprises a support board, a platform with a circular hole to support the bottle, an air pump (intended for bike tires), and some tubing and fittings to connect the pump to the bottle.\nHere's a close-up of the tubing and fittings. There is a rubber stopper (53/64\" to 63/64\" I.D.) that fits into the mouth of a pop bottle; an inflation needle was pushed through it to allow air to get into the bottle. 5/16\" tubing connects the needle to the air pump via a quick-connect fitting (so that the water in the bottle won't leak out while the air pump is being hooked up).\nTo launch a bottle rocket, you fill a bottle part-way with water (see the discussion below for how much), insert the stopper (as tight as possible), invert the bottle and place it in the hole on the launch pad with the tube hanging loose, join the tube to the air pump with the quick-connect fittings, and pump until the stopper pops off and the rocket launches.\nThe book The Secret Life of Equations by Rich Cochrane (previously mentioned here) has an entry on the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. It explains that,\nHere is the rocket equation, along with a couple of other ones (Bernoulli's equation and the work to compress air, W = P dV (which equates to the energy stored in compressed air), both rearranged to convenient forms with nil variables cancelled out) that are relevant to bottle rockets:\nΔv = vex ln (mi/mf)\nvex2 = 2 ((P2 – P1)/ρw)\nW = P2 V2 ln (P1/P2)\nIn these equations, v is for velocity, m is for mass, V is for volume, and P is for pressure (absolute, not gauge). The subscript 2 indicates conditions inside the bottle while 1 indicates outside (i.e. atmospheric). \"Delta v\" is the maximum change in velocity (which is the speed it could reach starting from zero) of the rocket in the absence of other forces; in reality it will be slowed down by gravity and air resistance. The exhaust velocity in the rocket is calculated from the second equation using the difference in the pressure within and outside the bottle. The final mass of the rocket is that of the empty pop bottle used while the initial mass mainly consists of the amount of water added. In the third equation, it can be seen that the energy stored is proportional to the pressure and volume of stored air.\nI put these equations (along with some basic equations of motion) into a spreadsheet to make a model to estimate how high a bottle rocket could be fired. It has some simplifications (e.g. the jet of water is assumed to be exhausted from the bottle at a constant velocity based on the initial difference in pressure, rather than decreasing as the compressed air expands as the water leaves, although it is restricted to not have a kinetic energy higher than the energy that was stored in the compressed air) but at least puts a boundary on the heights that could be achieved. Here's a graph from this model (the x-axis is how much water is added to a 1 L bottle):\nEven if it's just an approximation, the model (and examining the equations) makes some practical suggestions for launching bottle rockets:\nThe Christmas holidays also brought plenty of time to play board games with family and friends (and some new ones to try). I'll briefly mention a couple of highlights to wrap up this post:\nPandemic: Rising Tide has the theme of controlling flooding in the Netherlands, and the cooperative mechanics that the Pandemic series is known for: players compete against the game, which stochastically escalates in difficulty; either it spirals out of control and you lose, or you win together before that happens. Players need to balance urgent goals of repairing dikes and draining floodwaters with longer-term goals of building protective infrastructure.\nHive: Carbon is similar to chess in some ways. There are a small number of pieces (with multiples of some) and they each can move in a certain way. The goal is to surround your opponent's Queen (Bee). The most obvious difference from chess is that it is not played on a board. All of the pieces must always be touching; between that constraint and the geometry of the hexagonal tiles, the available positions are defined by the pieces themselves. Here's an example of a game:\nFor more of a strategic challenge, I'm wondering if different shapes of tiles could be included (e.g. squares + octagons or triangles + hexagons), such that the valid positions for a piece would be constrained further by where it will fit.\nPermalink",

I started a new relationship, tackled a project on my house (with a lot of help from family!), took an introductory whitewater kayaking course, and started writing a book.

    "content": "At the start of September, a friend on Facebook issued a challenge to read 10 books before the end of the year. I decided to share the brief reviews I wrote here.\nThe rules allowed for books you were in the middle of when the challenge was issued, so the first one I counted is Prodigal Prophet, by Rev. Tim Keller. I've read a few books by him before. They've all been worthwhile and this one was no exception.\nKeller takes a close look at the account of the prophet Jonah. He says that the book can be divided in half, with a parallel structure that emphasizes the major themes. In each half, the word of the Lord comes to Jonah, but he responds in different ways (the title comes from his behaviour in the first half fitting the younger son in the parable of the prodigal son, while in the second half he acts like the elder brother). This is followed by interaction with pagans, and then God humbles Jonah with a lesson on grace.\nThe book of Jonah is divided into two symmetrical halves—the records of Jonah's flight from God and then of his mission to Ninevah. Each part has three sections—God's word to Jonah, then his encounter with the Gentile pagans, and finally Jonah talking to God. Twice, then, Jonah finds himself in a close encounter with people who are racially and religiously different. In both cases his behaviour is dismissive and unhelpful, while the pagans uniformly act more admirably than he does. This is one of the main messages of the book, namely, that God cares how we believers relate to and treat people who are deeply different from us.\nProdigal Prophet contains some timely thoughts on nationalism and some timeless thoughts on grace and justice. One thing that Keller brings out in the book is that Jonah wasn't just being irrationally prejudiced: Ninevah was a violent society that posed a genuine threat to his homeland. So it was more of a lesson in loving your enemies (and remembering the grace you need too) than in thinking that the things that divide us are just superficial. And, drawing on C.S. Lewis' Four Loves, Keller explains that patriotism is a valid love but dangerous when it becomes inordinate. There's also a good contrast drawn between Jonah going outside the city to sulk and hope for judgement and Hebrews 13:12-13.\nMy second read was Eager: the surprising, secret life of beavers, and why they matter by Ben Goldfarb. It was well-written—even quite funny in places—while also being informative. Not at all dry.\nThere is a growing environmental perspective that doesn’t treat industry and agricultural as opponents but as potential partners. We can find ways to coexist with healthy ecosystems—often to mutual benefit. This book is very much in that camp when it comes to beaver. The excerpt below concerns the benefits that beaver ponds can offer in arid rangeland in terms of storing runoff and recharging groundwater. In wetter climates, their dams can attenuate floods (maybe NB should research whether larger beaver populations in the headwaters and tributaries of the Saint John River could help us out in this area).\nWater is a Nevada rancher's most important asset, and any force capable of capturing and retaining it is a godsend. Now, Holman told me, \"I'm probably one of the biggest advocates of the beaver.\" He's far from the species' only admirer in Elko County, where a series of promising grazing experiments suggest that beavers could become staunch agricultural allies. For that to happen, though, livestock producers—as tradition-bound a community as there is in the West—will have to reconsider their relationship with their aquatic nemesis.\nBeavers make rivers more dynamic, driving a cycle from free-flowing streams, to wetlands, to meadows, to new channels. People like our land uses to remain steady and predictable, so this dynamism is probably the hardest part about living with beavers. But the book includes some optimistic examples of individuals and small businesses trying out compromise solutions (basically ways to keep flow moving where it’s important to do so—such as avoiding flooding roads—without needing to remove the beaver). Overall it was a good read.\nMy third read was Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. It’s relatively short—I read it on a couple of flights (in a week in which I had seven)—but it’s heavy. It is framed like “Rime of the Ancient Mariner”, with a sailor recounting a tragic tale. The main character takes a contract captaining a river steamer in colonial Africa (it never says directly, but my understanding is it’s in the Belgian Congo). At an upriver ivory trading station he meets an agent of the Company who shouldn’t have ventured so far from the influence and constraints of civilization. While thematically bleak, Conrad’s writing is very evocative.\nNumber four was The Midnight Line by Lee Child, one of the books in the Jack Reacher series. It isn’t fine literature, just a solid genre novel.\nThe TV character Ron Swanson once said, “I’m a simple man. I like pretty, dark-haired women, and breakfast food”*. Jack Reacher would agree. He also likes travelling around America to the out-of-the-way cities and towns that don’t get featured in glossy brochures*; he’s a restless wanderer who doesn’t maintain a fixed address and has a knack for finding trouble. Because he’s a big bear of a man (the character should have been played by Ólafur Darri rather than Tom Cruise in the movies, in my opinion) and a retired major in the military police, he can handle most of the trouble he finds.\n*same here, to be honest\nErebus, by Michael Palin (of “Monty Python” game) was my fifth entry for this challenge. It is basically the biography of a ship. The ship Erebus is probably best known for its role in the Franklin expedition, but what I didn’t know before reading the book is that it had completed a mostly-successful (aside from not reaching the magnetic South Pole) three year Antarctic expedition a few years earlier under James Clark Ross. The latter part of the book is more exciting due to the greater drama associated with the Franklin expedition, but the earlier part was more extensively documented (since the ships returned with their logs intact). I really respect how much of the primary sources Palin must have read in writing this book—he was able to make the personalities of the crew of the Ross expedition leap off the page by quoting from their diaries and letters at key points. For example, one of the naturalists on board frequently wrote about his love and admiration for birds, which Palin juxtaposes with a running tally of how many he shot. Another thing that stands out is the infectious boldness (veering on over-confidence, to be fair) of the Victorian era: taking wooden sailing ships (propellers were added for the Franklin expedition) through hundreds of kilometres of sea ice, mapping the earth’s magnetic field, and outfitting a multi-year expedition in a matter of months. For example, this is from the description of the provisions for the Franklin Expedition:\nThree tons of tobacco and 200 gallons of wine were also loaded and, to ensure the all-important grog rations could be maintained, the two ships carried between them 4500 gallons of 130-140 proof West Indian rum ...\nBoth vessels had extensive libraries. Most ships were issued with the basic ‘Seaman’s Library’, but on this expedition it was augmented to some 1200 volumes per ship, with technical works on steam propulsion, accounts of previous Arctic expeditions, geographical and nautical magazines, the latest bestsellers\nNumber 6 in the challenge was Dune, by Frank Herbert. I've read this before but decided to re-read it in preparation for the movie scheduled to come out next year (directed by Denis Villeneuve, no less!). In the far-future universe of Dune, humanity responded to a robot uprising by getting rid of all computers. This left a need for advanced calculations (managing governmental and business databases, navigating through space, geneaology/genetics, etc.) to be done by specially-trained people, aided by a drug known as Spice that gives almost supernatural perception of branching or nested possibilities. Spice is only available on the planet Arrakis, colloquially known as Dune. At the start of the book, the emperor assigns a new noble house to take over its management—but such a prize won't change hands so easily.\nThe book can be labelled in many ways: a coming-of-age adventure story, a Cold War allegory, an archetypical Hero's Journey. The aspect that will probably always stand out foremost in my mind, though, is ecology. The world-building is detailed enough that the planet almost feels like another character. Arrakis is a desert planet and the scarcity of water is central to the plot. Some characters use water as a status symbol; some dream of terraforming; the local culture and indigeneous fauna have numerous adaptations for coping with the arid conditions. And the famous giant sandworms are integral to the ecology, not just shoe-horned into the plot for dramatic effect. The first appendix is even on the ecology of Arrakis, to give a sense of the amount of thought Herbert put into it.\nOne thing I noticed this time (with thinking about how it will be adapted to the screen) is that the pace of the plot becomes quite abrupt towards the climax and resolution.\nMy seventh book for the challenge was another re-read: The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis. Written in the form of letters from a senior devil to a junior one offering advice on temptation, the thing that stands out the most are some apt turns of phrase and wise observations:\nChristians describe [God] as one 'without Whom Nothing is strong'. And Nothing is very strong: strong enough to steal away a man's best years not in sweet sins but in a dreary flickering of the mind over it knows not what and knows not why\nthe Future is, of all things, the thing least like eternity. It is the most completely temporal part of time—for the Past is frozen and no longer flows, and the Present is all lit up with eternal rays.\nMuch of the modern resistance to chastity comes from men's belief that they 'own' their bodies—those vast and perilous estates, pulsating with the energy that made the worlds, in which they find themselves without their consent and from which they are ejected at the pleasure of Another.\n\"All those fasts and vigils and stakes and crosses are only a facade. Or only like foam on the seashore. Out at sea, out in His sea, there is pleasure, and more pleasure.\"\nA description of heaven attributed to another (but unnamed writer):\nthe regions where there is only life and therefore all that is not music is silence.\nThe earliest converts were converted by a single historical fact (the Resurrection) and a single theological doctrine (the Redemption) operating on a sense of sin they already had—and sin, not against some new fancy-dress law produced as a novelty by a 'great man', but against the old, platitudinous, universal moral law which they had been taught by their nurses and mothers.\nCowardice, alone of all the vices, is purely painful—horrible to anticipate, horrible to feel, horrible to remember; Hatred has its pleasures. It is therefore often the compensation by which a frightened man reimburses himself for the miseries of Fear. The more he fears, the more he will hate.\nThe eighth book I read for this challenge is one that I saw when I was browsing in Westminster Books and couldn't pass up: The Secret Life of Equations: the 50 greatest equations and how they work by Rich Cochrane. For each of the equations the author selected, he wrote a short profile (just 2 – 4 pages for most of them) explaining its scientific or historical significance and a bit about how it works mathematically. A number of the entries were nice refreshers for me—and I'd be so bold as to say that if you're not familiar with at least 10 of these equations already, your education's incomplete in the way C.P. Snow spoke about in \"The Two Cultures\"—but there were some new ones like the \"hairy ball theorem\" and ones I've heard of like Google's \"PageRank\" but now understand better.\nThe order in which the equations were presented was well-considered, as it was common for later entries to refer back to concepts from earlier ones. I wish more example calculations were included (some entries had them, and I found it rounded them out effectively), but that's a minor quibble. I'm hoping my own writing will also benefit, in terms of describing mathematical concepts in a straightforward way, from having read this book. Here's an example about tiling:\nThe fact that geometry is different on the sphere from the flat plane has been used in various decorative settings. A mundane example is the soccer ball, which is often covered entirely by a mixture of pentagons and hexagons. If you look closely you'll see all the pentagons and hexagons are regular, meaning their sides and angles are all the same—and of course they fit together nicely to cover the surface of the ball without any gaps. If you try to cover a flat piece of paper with regular hexagons and pentagons in this way, you'll soon find it can't be done. That's because on the flat piece of paper, the angles at a point must add up to 360 exactly, but the spherical excess on the soccer ball gives us more elbow room, enabling us to fit those corners together.\nThis fact is also exploited on a larger scale in the decorations found in some buildings, especially in the Islamic world where abstract geometric patterns were prefered to representational images. The problem of \"tiling\" a dome with polygons was already in an advanced state by the 10th century, when it was codified by Abul Wafa al-Buzjani. Since then, extremely elaborate patterns have been constructed on domes and similar surfaces that would be impossible on a flat surface—all made possible by the spherical excess.\nLiving the Sabbath by Norman Wirzba was my ninth entry for the challenge. After some discussion on the meaning of the Sabbath—delight in Creation, remembrance of deliverance, and rest (justly shared with the whole household, not hoarded by the powerful)—he gets into some practical advice. Most of the ideas seemed pretty good one by one, but all together they made the book feel like a tract for agrarianism (the foreward is even by Wendell Berry). I don't agree that getting back to the land—rolling back urbanization, international trade, digital communication, etc.—is a necessary or sufficient condition (to be fair, I'm not sure the author would go that far either) for embracing \"rhythms of rest and delight\" so that theme of the book was a bit of a miss for me. But it was thought-provoking, and as I said, it did have a lot of good individual points. One other thing I want to quibble about is that the book painted a very gloomy picture of the state of the environment. I feel that this kind of perspective relates to some of the cognitive instincts that Hans Rosling says can mislead us; while there are certainly environmental issues that need addressing, it's not the whole picture and areas of progress (e.g. ozone layer recovery, basically a halt in net deforestation rates, some species coming off the endangered list, declining death tolls from natural disasters) shouldn't be overlooked.\nAt the time of writing this post, I still need to read the tenth book, but with a week off from work I don't expect that will be a problem. I'm planning to read Harvesting the Biosphere by Vaclav Smil. Watch for a review sometime in the new year.\nI'll round this post out, however, by going back to a book I read in August, just before the challenge was issued. Screw the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Pleasant, Middle-Class Gated Community in Delhi by Claire Berlinski is about the experiences of a middle-aged white lady in India. Unlike many books in that genre, it's not about finding a spiritual awakening after a mid-life crisis; rather, the author is a journalist who went there with her eyes open for business opportunities. It's a short book (basically an expanded magazine article) but makes a compelling case. She points out that in a country as large as India, even economic growth of a few percent is a big deal in absolute terms. The culture sounds very entrepreneurial—it's noted that unlike Russia and China (two other BRIC countries), India never seriously tried to purge/eliminate its class of businessmen. As a democracy, India may be a better fit for trade and cooperation with the West than China. It also has more English speakers than the UK and in a few decades could have more university graduates than the US (apparently in the 1990s, 80% of IIT grads moved to the US, but now 80% stay in India so these trends are already in motion). Healthcare and education are some of the big areas of innovation there that caught the author's interest.\nMerry Christmas to all my readers!\nPermalink",

    "content": "Nomography is the art/science (both are involved) of graphical calculators. Using a nomogram, you can quickly solve an equation (but only the one it was designed for) with the aid of nothing more than a straightedge. It's something I've been interested in for quite a while, and finally feel that I have the material to make a good (hopefully!) post about it.\nI'll begin this post by talking about slide rules, because more people are probably familiar with them, and they share some mathematical principles with nomography. Slide rules have a number of different scales that can slide against each other. By aligning them in certain ways, you can perform various calculations. It's perhaps easy to see how they could be used for addition or subtraction: since those operations can be thought of as moving up or down a number line, offsetting two linear scales the correct distance from each other will deliver the result. For multiplication (and division), slide rules use the trick that logarithms turn multiplications into additions: the log of a product is the sum of the logs of its factors. (Logarithms also turn exponents into products). In the image below, a slide rule is being used to multiply 2.5 × 2; the operation can also be thought of as similar ratios (1:2.5 :: 2:5).\nNomography was only popular for slightly more than half a century. It was largely developed in the final decades of the 1800s, and waned after the invention of electronic calculators in the 1960s. As I said, it uses similar principles as slide rules. A big difference is that slide rules were general purpose (the scales could be slid against each other) while nomograms, being stationary graphics, were configured to solve a single equation.\nThere are various types of nomograms, but I'm only going to focus on the two that I think are the most useful: alignment nomograms with parallel axes, and \"N\" (sometimes called \"Z\") nomograms. The former are used to solve linear equations (or equations that can be linearized, as already noted) of three variables (and they can be compounded together to handle more variables) and the latter are used when one variable is the quotient of the other two (or the quotient of functions of the other two).\nVisualize three parallel lines (equally spaced), A, B, and C. If a straight line is drawn that intersects all three, the height at which it crosses B (the middle line) will be the average of where it crosses A and C. Stated as an equation, B = (A + C)/2 or A + C - 2B = 0. A basic nomogram can be created simply by rearranging an equation of interest into the same form, pairing its variables up with A, B, and C, and marking out the applicable scales on each line (not neglecting the factor of -2 that alters the scale on B). For example, the equation X × Y = Z can be linearized by taking the logarithm of each side and rearranged to log X + log Y - log Z = 0. Matching it with the earlier equation (this process reminds me of \"destructuring\" in Clojure) gives A = log X, C = log Y, and -2B = -log Z (or B = 0.5 log Z)—the nomogram is completed by marking each line with the scale stated by these paired-off equations.\nAnother way of looking at nomograms is through the geometry of similar triangles. This is explained here (the first post in a series that was a major source of information for my own post). This technique can be used in the construction or analysis of parallel or N type nomograms.\nA more powerful and general technique involves the use of determinants. The equation of interest is put into a standard determinant form:\nAs mentioned in the linked post (which is from another series that was a major resource for this post), the value of the determinant is zero, each row has equations of only one variable (this can require more \"destructuring\"), and the final column is all 1s. There are a number of valid manipulations (\"four rules\") that can be done to adjust determinants into this form. Once it is in the required form, the first two columns of each row are parametric equations that relate the x and y coordinates of each line or curve in the nomograph to a variable (one variable per line/curve) in the original equation (these variables are represented by a, b, and c in the table above).\nThe book by Dr. H.A. Evesham referenced below says:\nGiven a relationship F(x,y,z) = 0, can it be expressed in the determinant form given?\nIf it can, then an alignment nomogram can be constructed. (p.79)\nThe standard determinant form acts as a sort of bridge between the equations derived from the geometry of the lines of the nomogram (see the discussion above) and the equation you're trying to make a nomogram for, since they can both be mapped to this determinant structure (if making a nomogram is possible).\nThe main part of this post will give some instructions and examples for the determinant method of constructing nomograms.\nLike I said, it can be an iterative process to get something that looks good and has useful resolution in the key parts of the range.\n*Here are the basic nomographic forms for parallel and N type nomograms from the \"cheat sheet\" linked to earlier:\nParallel type: For an equation of the form f(a)+f(b)+f(c)=0, the determinant (also equal to zero) is:\nN type: For an equation of the form f(a)-f(b)/f(c)=0, the determinant (also equal to zero) is:\n(this actually gives perpendicular lines rather than a proper N, unless a shear factor is applied)\nIn order to verify that the determinants are correct, they can be expanded to check that the original equation is returned. I like the method described here of adding up the products of the diagonals from top-left to bottom-right and subtracting the products of the diagonals from top-right to bottom-left, wrapping around in both cases.\nThe following examples are of the Manning formula, Froude number (these first two were featured in a post I wrote earlier this year), the Ideal Gas Law, and the internal rate of return (IRR) of a perpetuity. Note that the first three are all in standard SI units.\nFor this one I made two nomograms with a match line and pasted them together in an image editor (which made the pasted side blurry, unfortunately). The lines crossing the two scales on either side of the match line should intersect on the match line. This is an example of how alignment nomograms can be compounded together to use more than three variables. Also note that it uses the simplification that the hydraulic radius is approximately equal to the depth when the width is much greater than the depth.\nThe Froude number determinant was multiplied by a shear matrix so that the proper N shape would result. The spacing on the scale for the depth (d) is irregular because the equation uses the square root of the variable.\nTo reduce the ideal gas law to three variables, I treated n/V (i.e. the concentration, or the inverse of the molar volume) as a single variable.\nThe ideal gas law nomogram has a line added (at SATP conditions) to show how a nomogram is used for calculations. Only two variables need to be known to draw a line like this, and the third/unknown variable can be read from the intersection point with the other scale.\nHere is the R code I used to draw this nomogram (the other ones were similar aside from the variable ranges, the precise parametric equations used, and the labelling):\nThere was a mistake in the determinant for the internal rate of return (IRR) equation on the sheet of hand calculations that I discovered and corrected while plotting. Where it says {1+i}/{2+i} it should have been {1+i}/{1+2i} instead. This figure shows how an N-type nomogram is plotted if the basic determinant form is used without making any adjustments. If using this nomogram, note that it applies for cashflows that extend indefinitely into the future (e.g. spending Po on some home energy efficiency project now to save Ft monthly on your power bill). Also note that the way the equation is set up, the first instance of Ft occurs simultaneously with Po, so you'll need to subtract it from Po if comparing with other implementations of the IRR equation.\nThese nomograms could be improved by choosing the scale spacing more carefully to make the labels more legible and perhaps by playing with functional moduli or other manipulations to obtain more detail in key parts of the range.\nSi, aux diverses variables entrant dans une équation, on a fait correspondre respectivement des systèmes d'éléments géométriques, cotés au moyen des valuers de ces variables, et tels qu'entre les éléments correspondant à un ensemble de ces valeurs satisfaisant simultanément à l'équation donnée il existe une liaison graphique simple, d'une immédiate constatation à vue, on a réalisé une représentation graphique de cette équation qui permet, si l'on se donne les valeurs de toutes les variables moins une, d'avoir, par simple lecture, la valeur correspondante de cette dernière.\nThis paragraph basically explains about making a graphic representation of an equation and using it to read off an unknown variable when the values of the others are all known. One can certainly imagine the value of this kind of technique in a time before electronic calculators and computers were available.\nPermalink",

    "content": "At a camping symposium this fall, I had the privilege of leading a workshop on wilderness water treatment. I figured it would also be of interest to share my notes here.\nNote: This information is only provided for educational purposes. Drink water in the backcountry at your own risk.\nThere's now a wide variety of products available in outdoor stores for treating water while camping or backpacking. The goal of the workshop I prepared was not to recommend one over another, but to help attendees understand the strengths and trade-offs associated with each so that they could make informed choices about which ones are most suitable for a particular situation. The workshop included two main components. The first (but pictured second below) was a poster I prepared covering the whys and hows of water treatment and the second (but pictured first) was unboxing some outdoor water treatment products, comparing how many uses they offered (and the price), demonstrating their use, and drinking some of the treated water—which did not make me sick, so success!\nIn the workshop, I spent a fair bit of time explaining and expanding on the poster/handout above. Here is an abbreviated version of some of those comments:\nHere are the links I included to read more about this topic:\nThe last one was of interest because there have been some alerts about cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae) in New Brunswick recently. Before collecting water in the backcountry, it's good to be informed of alerts like these.\nOn the following graphic of the effectiveness of different filtration methods, I added a vertical line representing the typical pore size of micro/ultrafiltration products sold for camping, along with molecular weight range of cyanotoxins (0.1 – 1 kDa). This shows that filtration on its own isn't a reliable treatment method for this type of contaminant.\nPermalink",

It is a small side table with a concrete top and an oak stand.\nOverall, the table is 22\" high and the top is 10\" x 10\". The main oak post is 1.5\" on each side and 18\" long; four legs are attached at 45 degree angles. The concrete slab is 1.25\" thick. It includes two layers of screen mesh* (roughly separating the thickness into thirds) for reinforcing.\n*The mesh I used was aluminum. I've seen some suggestions that aluminum can react with cement causing corrosion and that its thermal expansion is different, so hopefully it doesn't cause problems in the long term with cracking/spalling.\nTo prepare for pouring the concrete slab, I built a wooden frame and lined it with wax paper. The block used to keep a hole in the middle of the slab for the support post would not come out after the concrete had cured, so it had to be drilled and cut into pieces for removal.\nThe concrete mix was a fast-setting product from Quikrete with a compressive strength of 20 MPa after 24 hours and 40 MPa after a month. It's only workable for 20 – 30 minutes, which was barely enough time for working into the corners of the form and smoothing out the exposed face (which ended up being the underside of the table, so it was less important to have a smooth and finished look).\nFor attaching the legs and the collar around the post to support the slab, I used glue along with dowels inserted into drilled holes (using a jig made from a scrap piece of wood to ensure the hole spacing would be the same between pieces).\nAfter building it, I finished it with three coats of a spray-on semi-gloss lacquer to both the wood and concrete.\nHere are some photos taken during the construction process:\nIf you enjoyed this post, here are some other pieces I made not too long ago.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A couple of times per year, I like to share some links I've collected—especially if they relate to topics I've blogged about. It seemed like a decent way to (try) getting back into posting.\nThere are a lot of lists on Wikipedia. To organize them, there are lists of lists on certain topics. Going up yet another level, here's a list of lists of lists.\nIf you're in the eastern US and looking to fit in a short hike (a situation I find myself in not infrequently), a good option is often to look for a nearby stretch of the Appalachian Trail with suitable access. This page has some suggestions. In another region, I found the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie to be a nice spot to stop for a walk in the Chicago area.\nThis is an interesting environmental idea from The Nature Conservancy: Blue Bonds. They have a plan to refinance the debt of island nations at favourable terms in exchange for protecting important ocean habitat.\nThe Ganges River in India is notoriously polluted, but not far away is another one that is significantly cleaner:\nThe difference is rooted in thousands of years of stigma. Unlike the sacred Ganges, the Chambal and surrounding land are traditionally regarded as cursed and dangerous badlands.\n...\nBut that notorious past may just have proved the Chambal river’s saving grace. It limited the growth of cities and polluting factories on its banks, while local wheat farmers and cattle herders have used its resources cautiously.\nOn the subject of water resources in India, I recently heard about stepwells. I'm surprised they weren't mentioned in books I've read about the history of water resources management such as Thirst. A more cutting edge strategy is industrial water reuse.\nThe Hokou system of local registration in China means that people who migrate to big cities for work often don't have the same level of access to services as the people who were born in those cities.\nOne of the books on my reading list for 2020 is The City of God by St. Augustine, so I looked up a reading plan for it.\nBack in the summer, I made cold brew coffee that turned out pretty well. I think these were the instructions that I basically followed.\nPlay this game to see how well you are at guessing about recent trends in the world.\nI found a forum thread about construction projects in my hometown that's been kept going for over a decade!\nSome insightful thoughts about rules and compliance costs:\nRules, of course, are often necessary, but always impose some difficulty or inconvenience on those who have to follow them.\nThe burden of a rule can be separated into (at least) two components.\nFirst, there’s the direct opportunity cost of not being allowed to do the things the rule forbids. (We can include here the penalties for violating the rule.)\nSecond, there’s the “cost of compliance”, the effort spent on finding out what is permitted vs. forbidden and demonstrating that you are only doing the permitted things.\nSeparating these is useful. You can, at least in principle, aim to reduce the compliance costs of a rule without making it less stringent.\nAs the article goes on to discuss, sometimes inhibiting action-taking is a desirable effect, but sometimes it's better to have very little friction for things that no one objects to. Thinking about such side effects of the way rules and permissions are structured could help various organizations run more effectively.\nThis urban planner has had an interesting life that informs the less-rigid approach to housing and transportation policy that he advocates.\nSomething I've been trying to learn more about this year (since writing this post) is boat wakes.\nFinally, here's Ian McKellen reading one of my favourite poems:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Sorry about having such a long gap between posting. I've been on a couple of business trips, and when I've been home my social calendar and the hot weather haven't left many good opportunities to sit down at my computer and write.\nSea People: The Puzzle of Polynesia by Christina Thompson is a book about the history of Polynesia, the far-flung islands in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Because there weren't written records prior to European exploration of that area, the book is also an account of how the clues were put together to arrive at the current understanding of the history there. The central question of the book is how the Polynesian people managed to reach and settle all those islands:\nThey had no knowledge of writing or metal tools—no maps or compasses—and yet they succeeded in colonizing the largest ocean on the planet, occupying every habitable rock between New Guinea and the Galápagos, and establishing what was, until the modern era, the largest single culture area in the world.\nPolynesia is the triangle formed by Hawai'i, New Zealand, and Easter Island. In addition to those islands, it also contains Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, French Polynesia (Tahiti, etc.), Cook Islands, Wallis & Futuna, and Tokelau. Adjacent to Polynesia are other groups of Pacific islands: Micronesia (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Guam, and the Northern Marinara Islands) and Melanesia (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia). The geography of Polynesia contains a mix of 'low' and 'high' tropical islands, plus New Zealand:\nAll the islands in the mid-Pacific are either high or low, volcanic or coralline. But down in the southwest corner, near the ocean’s edge, there is a large and important group of islands with an entirely different geologic history. New Zealand is one of the anchoring points of the Polynesian Triangle and a key piece of the Polynesian puzzle, but it differs from other Polynesian islands in several ways. It lies much farther south, in latitudes comparable to the stretch of North America that extends from North Carolina to Maine. It is temperate, not tropical; it can be hot in summer, but in the winter, at least in the south, it snows. New Zealand is also vast by comparison, with plains, lakes, rivers, fjords, mountain ranges, and a land area more than eight times that of all the other islands of Polynesia combined.\nThe Maori people of New Zealand arrived from elsewhere in Polynesia only a few hundred years before Europeans did (and had to contend with terrifying moa birds), representing the final stage of Polynesian expansion. The author's husband is Maori, giving her a personal connection to the subject matter.\nThe book is divided into six parts. It begins with the initial contact between the Polynesians and the outside world and then in a sense goes forward in time to go back in time&mash;it recounts various explorations, studies, and theories in the order in which they developed, retracing how light was shed on the past (with a few false steps along the way). The following excerpt does a good job summarizing the approach Thompson took:\nThe problem, of course, is that we are talking about prehistory. It is hard enough to know what happened in the past when there exists a documentary record, but there is no written record of these events. Here, the evidence is all partial, ambiguous, open to widely differing interpretations, and in some cases so technical that it is difficult for a layperson to judge. When I first set out to write this book, I imagined I would be recounting the tale of the voyagers themselves, those daring men and women who crossed such stupendous tracts of sea and whose exploits constitute one of the greatest adventures in human history. But, almost immediately, it dawned on me that one could tell such a story only by pretending to know more than can actually be known. This realization quickly led me to another: that the story of the Polynesian settlement of the Pacific is not so much a story about what happened as a story about how we know. The evidence for what happened in the Pacific has taken different forms in different eras. In the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, it consisted of the eyewitness reports of European explorers, who left sketchy but fascinating accounts of Polynesian cultures before they had begun to change under the influence of the outside world. From the nineteenth century we have a different type of source material: Polynesian oral traditions, or what the islanders had to say about themselves. Then, starting in the early twentieth century, science began to deliver up whole new bodies of information based on biometrics, radiocarbon dating, and computer simulations. And, finally, in the 1970s, an experimental voyaging movement emerged, which added a completely different dimension to the story.\nThis review would be far too long if I tried to discuss all of the angles of evidence that Thompson considers. I found the parts about oral history, linguistics, and archaeology of pottery all interesting, but I'm going to focus on the computer simulations and experimental voyaging (both covered in Part 5) as these aspects fit into topics I have an ongoing interest in.\nBefore getting into that, I'll mention that Sea People spends a lot of time on Captain Cook, as he was one of the first people to personally experience how big the Pacific is. He visited a number of islands, and noticed that even thousands of miles apart the inhabitants looked similar and their languages sounded similar. A navigator from Tahiti named Tupaia joined his ship; I've read about the map he made before, but Sea People filled in a lot more detail:\nFifty of the names on these lists can be correlated with islands that we can identify today. The implication is striking: Tupaia and his fellow Tahitians appear to have had knowledge of islands stretching east–west from the Marquesas to Samoa, a distance of more than two thousand miles, and south some five hundred miles to the Australs. Tupaia did not claim to have visited all of the islands whose names he knew; he told Cook that he himself had firsthand knowledge of only twelve. But he had second- or thirdhand knowledge of several more;\nIt is a truly remarkable artifact: a translation of Tahitian geographical knowledge into European cartographic terms at the very first moment in history when such a thing might have been possible; a collaboration between two brilliant navigators coming from geographical traditions with essentially no overlap; a fusion of completely different sets of ideas.\nEuropean charts, such as those that Tupaia was introduced to by Cook, depicted the world in terms of conceptual systems that were entirely alien to Tahitians. Position, distance, and direction were defined in terms of a mathematical scheme of measurement based on the size and shape of the earth. The perspective was not that of a participant on the ground but of an observer high in the sky, the so-called bird’s-eye view. What such charts most emphatically do not capture is the way we actually experience geography—the perspective, for example, of someone standing on the deck of a boat.\nGoing into the second half of the twentieth century, one of the research questions about the history of Polynesia was whether new islands had been settled deliberately, or by canoes getting lost and drifting to them. Various theories were put to the test by computer simulations and experimental voyages. A well-known experimental voyage was that of Thor Heyerdahl and his raft \"Kon-Tiki\". His theory that the first settlers of Polynesia had drifted from South America isn't really credited anymore, but actually putting it to the test was an important development.\nThe way the Pacific Ocean circulates is quite consistent (see here for a discussion of circulation in another ocean) so computer modelling of the drift hypothesis was possible:\nOut of more than 120,000 simulated voyages, begun at points all over the Pacific and conducted at all times of the year, some highly likely drift routes did emerge. These included Tonga to Fiji, Pitcairn to the Tuamotus, the Marquesas to the Tokelaus, and several others, all of which entailed travel from east to west. Almost no drifts going the other way, from west to east, emerged from the experiment. The results gave “no support” to the possibility of drifting along what was then envisioned as a likely Polynesian pathway from Samoa to the Marquesas, while the chance of drifting from Samoa to the Society Islands was less than one in seven hundred.\nBecause other evidence was suggesting the ancestors of the Polynesians had come from Asia rather than South America, they would have had to travel in the opposite direction from what accidental drifting could likely achieve. The next piece of the puzzle was to demonstrate whether deliberate long-distance voyaging would have been possible with the equipment and techniques available at the time.\nPolynesian culture (and the closely related Micronesian culture) contained a unique tradition of navigation techniques (they've been mentioned in other books I've read but not in as much detail as here). These techniques included navigating by stars and swells, numerous ways to find land (from beyond visual distance), and mental models and mnenomics to assist with instrument-free navigation.\nStars appear to move across the night sky as the earth rotates, but they rise from a consistent spot on the horizon, night after night. For example, according to a circular slide rule star chart I have for my latitude, Orion rises in the east (the time it rises shifts through the year, however: 7 p.m. in December, 9 p.m. in November, 11 p.m. in October, and 1 a.m. in September), Sagittarius in the southeast, and Gemini in the northeast (of course different cultures have different constellations). The sequence of constellations that rise from a certain direction through the night define a star path.\nAnother technique for finding direction was to pay attention to the swells. My understanding is that long-period waves (i.e. swell) will come from a consistent direction since they require steady winds (like trade winds) blowing across long stretches of open ocean:\nBut they also used another very important—and, to Westerners, much less familiar—technique: that of reading the ocean swells. Swells are not the same as waves. Waves are a local phenomenon thrown up by winds in the immediate vicinity; swells, by contrast, are waves that originate far away and travel beyond the winds that generate them. The important swells, those created by enduring weather patterns like the trade winds or the westerlies in the South Pacific Ocean, tend to have long wavelengths and to move past the boat “with a slow, swelling undulation.” This does not necessarily mean they are easy to recognize, for in practice the actual pattern of waves and swells at any particular point will be a complicated mix of “systems that differ in height, length, shape, and speed moving across each other from different directions.”\nFor a navigator to pick out the swell, he would do something like an implicit Fourier transform:\nSometimes, [a navigator said], he would lie down on the outrigger platform, the more clearly to feel the pitch and roll of his canoe and thus disentangle the different forces.\nFinding land from a distance used a variety of techniques, such as observing birds, clouds, and swell:\nThe last piece of the Oceanic navigational puzzle is the set of landfinding techniques, sometimes referred to as “expanding the target.” Birds, as one of Lewis’s instructors explained, “are the navigator’s very best friends.” If a low island can be seen at about ten miles, the range of terns and noddies—land birds that return to their islands at night—is twice that, while boobies, which fly “low and arrow-straight for the horizon” at dusk, are known to travel as many as fifty miles from land.\nIn addition to bird lore, there is cloud lore: the way clouds will move slowly over an island “as if stuck” and then speed up once they are past it; or the “brightness” of clouds over an island as compared with those over the sea; or the way a land cloud will lie, at first, like other clouds on the horizon but, if you watch long enough, will appear to hover or keep re-forming while other clouds dissipate or move on.\nFinally, there is the technique known as “wave piloting.” This is a version of navigating by swells, but with the added complication that in the vicinity of islands, waves are both reflected and refracted by the land. This creates complicated patterns of interference, which in the Marshall Islands have historically been depicted by stick charts made from the ribs of palm fronds, with shells to indicate the positions of islands. These stick charts have often been described as maps, but they are not maps or charts in the way we might think of them. They are teaching tools and mnemonic devices, part of an instructional tool kit used by experienced navigators to communicate concepts, and not something that would ever be relied upon at sea.\nI've seen stick charts at some maritime museums I've visited (that post also mentions experimental archaeology, which I'll be discussing below). I'm reminded of something I read in The Sea: A Cultural History by John Mack about the importance of mnenomics for traditional navigation. As I wrote in my review of that book:\nIn spite of the factual nature of his subject matter, [ibn Majid] did much of his writing in poetic verse. Mack draws parallels between the sensory engagement that is stimulated by poetry and the engagement with environment that good traditional navigation requires. Verse also serves a mnemonic function.\nThe following passages illustrate how Polynesian navigators approached their task from a different mindset than European navigators:\nCarolinian navigators use a system known as etak, in which they visualize a “reference island”—which is usually a real island but may also be imaginary—off to one side of the path they are following, about midway between their starting point and their destination. As the journey progresses, this island “moves” under each of the stars in the star path, while the canoe in which the voyagers are traveling stays still. Of course, the navigators know that it is the canoe and not the islands that are moving, but this is the way they conceptualize the voyage.\nWhat is not easily conveyed in accounts of traditional navigational techniques is a sense of how navigation is experienced by its practitioners: not as an array of discrete techniques but as “a unity,” “the sum of input from such disparate sources as stars, swells, and birds being processed through training and practice into a confident awareness of precisely where they were at any one time”—a description that, in itself, seems to capture some of the difficulty.\nTour thinking is sometimes understood to differ from map thinking in the same way that orality differs from literacy. And one can see how features of non-instrumental navigation overlap with other systems for managing knowledge in an oral culture: the first-person perspective, the emphasis on experience, the encoding of information in narrative form.\nThis description of tour thinking exemplifies one of the strengths of Thompson's writing. She remains aware of how different people have different perspectives shaped by their cultural background (e.g. literate cultures tend to have a more linear narrative structure than oral cultures) and points out the implications of this in several places.\nAll of these navigational techniques sound impressive in a book, but do they work? Without a time machine, no one can directly observe Polynesian voyages from around a millenia ago. This is where experimental archaeology comes in. It attempts to replicates past achievements using tools available at the time to provide a demonstration or proof-of-concept that a hypothesized way they were performed was possible—not to fully prove that they occurred in exactly that way. The Polynesian Voyaging Society (which is still active) undertook a seminal voyage from Hawai'i to Tahiti in a double-hulled canoe in the 1970s. Its legacy included not only scientific work, but a renewed appreciation for Polynesian culture:\nFinney had written in some frustration in the 1970s that it had been “naïve” to think that the goals of “scientific research and cultural revival could be easily combined,” and there was always tension around the notion that the Polynesian Voyaging Society embodied two seemingly conflicting ways of looking at the world. But, in fact, almost everything about Hokule‘a had been syncretic from the start. The canoe itself was based on traditional designs that had been recorded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by European observers, interpreted by the Chicago Art Institute–trained Hawaiian artist Herb Kane, and constructed with modern materials like fiberglass and plywood. The chants and ceremonies surrounding the voyages were a blend of contemporary Hawaiian cultural practices, ceremonies from other parts of Polynesia, and traditional sources recorded in the nineteenth century by men like Abraham Fornander and S. Percy Smith. But the most thrilling example of fusion was the navigational method pioneered by Nainoa and subsequently taught to navigators all across the Pacific: a mix of Mau’s Carolinian knowledge, modern astronomical information, and innovations that the young Hawaiian had arrived at on his own.\nMore recent research, including genetics—not just of the people but of the \"portmanteau biota\" they carried between islands (such as dogs, pigs, chickens, and rats)—is the topic of the final part of the book. To wrap this post up, I'll share the current understanding of the spread of people through the Pacific, according to Sea People:\nThe Lapita people were still envisioned as having reached Samoa and Tonga in the neighborhood of 900 B.C., but the initial settlement of central and eastern Polynesia had moved much closer to the present. According to the new orthodoxy, none of the archipelagoes of central and eastern Polynesia (the Society Islands, Hawai‘i, the Marquesas, Easter Island, the Cooks) is thought to have been settled before the end of the first millennium A.D., while the discovery and settlement of New Zealand was pushed as far forward as A.D. 1200.\nSome of this timeline actually lines up pretty well with early research based on compiling oral history from the region:\nFornander specifically noted an efflorescence of tales about “bold expeditions, stirring adventures, and voyages undertaken to far-off lands,” from which he deduced an era of “national unrest” and “tribal commotion” right around the year 1000. Smith similarly proposed a muddled early settlement phase for New Zealand, but his dates for the arrival of the first named Maori ancestors were 1150 and 1350, exactly straddling the date proposed for the settlement of New Zealand in the cleaned-up radiocarbon chronology.\nChristina Thompson really emphasizes the variety of different kinds of evidence that has gone into unravelling the history of this part of the world:\nTo the extent that this history has been disentangled, however, it has been thanks to input of radically different kinds. At one end of the spectrum are the mathematical models: the computer simulations, chemical analyses, statistical inferences—science with all its promise of objectivity and its periodic lapses into error. At the other, the stories and songs passed from memory to memory: the layered, subtle, difficult oral traditions, endlessly open to interpretation but unique in their capacity to speak to us, more or less directly, out of a pre-contact Polynesian past.\nOverall, this was a very interesting read.\nHere are a few other things I've been up to recently:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This past weekend, I went on my first camping trip of 2019.\nI started off the weekend in the town of St. Andrew's, walking around and looking in a few shops.\nJust outside the town is the Caughey-Taylor nature preserve. I've previously mentioned wanting to go for a hike there, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. I hiked the Sam Orr Pond trail. A couple of hundred metres from the trailhead it comes to a T. The trail to the right leads to a rock sill (a natural dam) at the mouth of the pond. Apparently at high tide, salt water from the Passamaquoddy Bay can flow back into the pond (making it a unique brackish water ecosystem), but I knew from what I'd seen in St. Andrew's (see the above photo of the wharf) that it was close to low tide so the rock sill would not be submerged. The footing was slippery crossing the sill, but I didn't get my feet too wet. Once across, I turned left to circle back around the pond to the initial junction (another section of the trail continues out to Berry Point).\nThe loop that I hiked only took about an hour (as mentioned, it could be extended by following another section of trail). It's a very nice trail; the varied terrain along the Fundy coast and the meeting of diverse ecosystems pack a lot to see into even relatively short trails. Here are some photos I took along the trail:\nThe woods were nice and mossy and I saw a crab while crossing the sill:\nHere is a view looking into the pond from a rocky outcrop with a good vantage. The sill at the pond entrance can be clearly seen:\nAnother trail in that general area that looks good (that I'll keep in mind for next time) is Simpson Hill.\nI went camping (in my own tent, but they had structured tents there that looked pretty cool) at New River Beach provincial park. While I was there, I also hiked part of a trail in the park. I didn't do the full loop, but I went as far as one of the lookout points on the Chittick's Beach trail. It had a nice boardwalk; here are a couple of photos from that hike:\nAlso on the subject of hiking in southwestern New Brunswick, I heard an interview on the radio while I was down there about a hopefully upcoming project to start developing a coastal link trail to link the East Coast Greenway with the Trans Canada Trail!\nAnyway, I hope this weekend was just the start (not counting one I did in the spring while I was down in Pennsylvania) of some nice hikes and other outdoor activities this summer.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I recently took a sales course for my job. Some of the discussion there prompted some thoughts about ideas I've read/heard and how they relate to the modern business world.\nI initially came across the concept of \"legibility\" in a book review of Seeing Like A State by James C. Scott. Although I haven't read the full book, I've read an essay by the author to get a further grasp on this concept. It begins with the following paragraph:\nState naming practices and local, customary naming practices are strikingly different. Each set of practices is designed to make the human and physical landscape legible, by sharply identifying a unique individual, a household, or a singular geographic feature. Yet they are each devised by very distinct agents for whom the purposes of identification are radically different. Purely local, customary practices, as we shall see, achieve a level of precision and clarity—often with impressive economy—perfectly suited to the needs of knowledgeable locals. State naming practices are, by contrast, constructed to guide an official “stranger” in unambiguously identifying persons and places, not just in a single locality, but in many localities using standardized administrative techniques.\nLegibility, in Scott's usage, refers to the way governments put standardized labels on everything from roads to people. He gives an example of how a road between the towns of Guilford and Durham might be known as the Durham road to people on one end and the Guildford road to people on the other end but the state maps will label it as Route 77 to avoid confusion (since many towns around Durham will have a \"Durham road\"). The conventional name is more useful to locals, since it tells them where the road goes, while the standardized number is more useful to officials governing a wide area since it removes ambiguity.\nOver time there has been a trend towards making things more tractable to distant officials. This has included everything from land surveys (which came up a lot a couple of posts ago) and even permanent last names:\nThe invention of permanent inherited patronyms was, along with the standardization of weights and measures, uniform legal codes, and the cadastral land tenure survey, a vital technique in modern statecraft. It was, in nearly every case, a state project designed to allow officials to identify unambiguously the majority of its citizens. The armature of the modern state: tithe and tax rolls, property rolls, conscription lists, censuses, deeds, birth, marriage and death certificates recognized in law were inconceivable without some means of fixing an individual’s identity and linking him or her to a kin group.\nI also thought this point from the essay was interesting, about the way that measures taken to increase legibility can have unintended consequences:\nThe quest for legibility, when joined to state power, is not merely an “observation.” By a kind of fiscal Heisenberg principle, it has the capacity the change the world it observes. The window and door tax established in France under the Directory and abolished only in 1917 is a striking case in point. Its originator must have reasoned that the number of windows and doors in a dwelling was almost perfectly proportionate to the dwelling’s size. Thus a tax assessor need only walk around the house counting the windows and doors to estimate its size. As a simple expedient, it was a brilliant stroke, but not without consequences. Peasant dwellings were subsequently designed or renovated with the formula in mind so as to have as few apertures as possible! While the fiscal losses could be recouped by raising the tax per opening, the effects on the long term health of the rural population lasted for than a century.\nOf relevance to this post is the point that this concept of legibility is applicable to corporations not just governments:\nIntervention in society (or nature) for whatever purpose (e.g. delivering welfare benefits to those with particular disability or keeping watch on political enemies) requires creating the mapping or optics necessary to legibility. In Seeing Like a State, and as a student of politics, I concentrate on state-making and government. Nevertheless, as I endeavor to make clear, large-scale capitalism is just as much an agency of homogenization, uniformity, grids, and heroic simplification as the state, with the difference that, for capitalists, simplification must pay. The profit motive compels a level of simplification and tunnel vision that, if anything, is more heroic that the early scientific forest of Germany. In this respect, the conclusions I draw from the failures of modern social engineering are as applicable to market-driven standardization as they are to bureaucratic homogeneity.\nScott's essay is part of a magazine issue that includes some response essays. A reponse by Donald Boudreaux raises the point that making things more legible, while it can lead to a loss of specialized local knowledge, can also facilitate positive interactions (not just for the officials driving the increased legibility) over a wider area. For example, standardized units of measure facilite trade in markets and social security numbers have been a useful form of identification for the financial industry, not just for the government that assigned them.\nJames Scott’s fascinating essay reminds us that trade-offs are inescapable. Much useful local knowledge is indeed lost when names and other descriptors of roads, rivers, and even family lines are changed from their original, localized, and idiosyncratic expressions into synoptic, standardized expressions that are meaningful to a larger and more diverse group of people. In return, though, something useful is gained — namely, greater coordination among larger numbers of people.\nHere's another review of Scott's book.\nOne of the papers I read recently on irrigation (by Alston and Smith) included this statement:\nFrom the insight that transaction costs define observed economic outcomes in important ways (Coase 1937) came the recognition that the costs of specifying, enforcing, and exchanging rights to property are an essential example of the deep significance of transaction costs.\nI decided to read this paper by Coase, titled \"The Nature of the Firm\" since I'd also heard about it elsewhere, such as in a podcast I listened to recently (incidentally featuring Donald Boudreaux who was quoted above).\nThis paper is trying to arrive at a useful technical definition of a firm. It starts off by explaining that in economic theory the use of resources and actions by different participants in the market are coordinated by price signals, without relying on any central director. However, within a firm there is someone directing things:\nIf a workman moves from department Y to department X, he does not go because of a change in relative prices, but because he is ordered to do so.\nAs D.H. Robertson points out, we find \"islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious co-operation...\" But in view of the fact that it is usually argued that co-ordination will be done by the price mechanism, why is such organization necessary? Why are there these \"islands of conscious power\"? Outside the firm, price movements direct production, which is co-ordinated through a series of exchange transactions on the market. Within a firm, these market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur-co-ordinator, who directs production.\nThis leads to the observation that,\nthe distinguishing mark of the firm is the supersession of the price mechanism. ... [A] distinction between the allocation of resources in a firm and the allocation in the [capitalist] economic system...\nAnd the central question of the paper is that,\nit is surely important to enquire why co-ordination is the work of the price mechanism in one case and of the entrepreneur in another.\nSome reasons that Coase brings forward are the costs associated with price discovery and the difference in efficiency between standing contracts compared to one-time contracts:\nThe main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism. ... that of discovering what the relevant prices are. ... The costs of negotiating and concluding a separate contract for each exchange transaction which takes place on a market must also be taken into account.\nThis raises the implication that if it becomes easier to make short-term and one-off contracts (e.g. gig economy, smart contracts on the blockchain) then maybe big companies will become less common and more people will work as independent contractors.\nBecause \"it is always possible to revert to the open market\" if the organizing authorities of a firm fail to add effeciency, the transactions taking place within a firm need to be justified by having a efficiency gain from smoother coordination than what can be achieved by price signals. The potential to capture a monopoly provides an incentive for companies to grow, but this is countered by a loss of efficiency with increasing size:\nas a firm gets larger, ... the costs of organizing additional transactions within the firm may rise. Naturally, a point must be reached where the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm are equal to the costs involved in carrying out the transaction in the open market\nAs I understand it, this approach of marginal analysis of transaction costs (internal and external) to determine the theoretically optimal boundary of a firm is the enduring legacy of Coase's 1937 paper:\nThe question always is, will it pay to bring an extra exchange transaction under the organising authority?\nHaving introduced these concepts, I want to spend this final section of this post thinking about how they fit together and apply to the modern business world. In a company, management needs to allocate labour and resources more efficiently than they could fill the same functions by going to the open market. One thing that makes this goal possible is transaction costs. For example, hiring a consultant and hiring an employee both take up time in soliciting proposals/resumes, evaluating them, and negotiating with the selected candidate. However, a consultant will generally do a task and write a report and then move on, while an employee can be assigned a whole series of tasks and reports; the upfront investment of time in finding a candidate is spread out over more output in the case of the employee, lowering the transaction cost. So as long as a company has enough work for someone with particular skills, it's probably more efficient to have them as an employee than as a consultant. Another factor that can help management meet their goals is detailed knowledge of the company. In the case of small businesses, or large businesses that are still led by a founder or by someone who rose through the ranks and knows the business intimately, this knowledge comes from \"local\" experience. In the case of large companies led by professional managers who have MBAs rather than a background in the specific field at hand, however, the business operations need a high level of legibility to provide this knowledge.\nTools for making business processes more legibile include ERP software. From what I've seen, the types of effects discussed by James Scott are certainly present in this domain. Although it makes business processes more visible to management through the dashboards and automated reports available in the software, the uniformity imposed (across different product lines, office locations, etc.) can lead to losses in utility. This is because reality is fractally complex and the map is not the territory. Any system of legibility (i.e. simplified, standardized labels) will have cases where it doesn't capture the full picture. To satisfy an ERP system, people in one office might have to waste time collecting information they don't need, while people in another office might have nowhere to enter information they do need. When individuals have more discretion, they can tweak things to meet the \"local\" needs, but when uniformity is imposed, some details are inevitably lost in the reduced granularity.\nMore generally, for all the benefits metrics/KPIs can bring to companies (and other organizations), they are not without drawbacks, as Jerry Muller has written (and discussed on a podcast). These include things like an incentive to game metrics, a loss of focus on anything not captured by the metrics, the transaction cost (which fits in well with this post) of tracking them, and their tendency to stifle innovation:\nCompelling people in an organisation to focus their efforts on a narrow range of measurable features degrades the experience of work. Subject to performance metrics, people are forced to focus on limited goals, imposed by others who might not understand the work that they do. Mental stimulation is dulled when people don’t decide the problems to be solved or how to solve them, and there is no excitement of venturing into the unknown because the unknown is beyond the measureable. The entrepreneurial element of human nature is stifled by metric fixation. (emphasis added)\nThings that are unknown (especially unknown unknowns) don't fit easily into categorization schemes, so they are inherently resistent to legibility. But this is also the domain where some of the greatest rewards (and risks) can be found.\nWhat is the alternative to an excessive pursuit of legibility? I would say at least part of the answer is a respect for local knowledge and a robust network of relationships. Although price signals generally aren't used within a firm, as Coase discussed, that doesn't mean other forms of decentralized information sharing and feedback can't be. Consider this image of an artificial neural network from Wikipedia:\nImagine a sales team that functioned like this. Someone represented by a red circle might get a request from a customer. Maybe they have dealt with that customer before, or it's in their geographic territory, or they represent a product line that the customer thinks is the best solution for them (whether or not it actually is). In a large enough company, an individual sales person might not know all the product lines that are available. But if he/she can talk to various people (represented by the blue circles) who have local knowledge about different divisions of the company, hopefully one of them can pass the request to the appropriate product specialist (represented by the green circles). If there is positive feedback when a request makes its way to the right person, over time those relationships will be strengthened so that the frontline salespeople have strong connections to the specialists dealing with products that are the best fit for the customers they encounter. Other approaches would be to split the company up if internal transaction costs (not necessarily in money but in time and general frictional inefficiencies) are higher than just going to the wider marketplace, or to take steps to make the sales process more legible and structure it into silos such that each salesperson will be aware of all the products that might be relevant to any customers he/she is likely to encounter. But if the silos are too rigid, then some unforeseen (i.e. unknown and hard to measure as mentioned above) opportunities may be missed; thus I still think robust networks of relationships are a good thing to promote within a business or other organization.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A universal basic income is an idea that's getting some buzz. I decided to do some rough calculations to see what an implementation would look like.\nA universal basic income (UBI) is a concept where everyone in a country/province/state gets a regular cheque from the government. It's usually envisioned to be an amount that's enough to live on, but not enough for luxuries. The money people receive comes with no strings attached and there is no means testing to make sure it only goes to people who need it. Instead, the government plans to get the money back through increased taxes*. The concept is quite elegant. It removes the stigma of being on welfare because everybody receives it. It removes the \"trap\" that many welfare programs have where finding a job can make someone worse off because entry-level wages are less than the benefits they're receiving while not working. And it is easier and cheaper to administer because there is no need for evaluations or enforcement (dramatized here as a PEI EI PI checking in on someone on pogey) to make sure no one is taking advantage of the program without being eligible (since everyone is eligible).\n*Current programs that have the most in common with a UBI are often funded through natural resource royalties, however.\nOne candidate for US President in 2020, Andrew Yang, includes a UBI in his platform. He is worried that technological changes will leave many people unemployed and in need of an alternate form of provision. His plan is to give every American over 18 $1,000 per month; this would be paid for in part by a value added tax (VAT)—the United States does not currently have a national sales tax. The rest of the cost for this program (around $4 billion per year) would be covered by savings from winding down other welfare programs (plus he thinks there will be less spending on hospitals and prisons if everyone is provided for by a UBI), increased economic activity stimulated by the UBI, and some other taxes such as a carbon tax and a financial transactions tax. The first two items (i.e. VAT and savings) are each expected to raise around $800 million; this only gets to around 40% of the overall price tag, so the plan counts on a lot of extra economic activity being stimulated.\nFor the scenario in this post, I'm going to consider this plan applied to the province of New Brunswick (since I'm already familiar with a lot of the relevant numbers about the provincial budget and the economy).\nBecause New Brunswick already has a carbon tax and doesn't have much of a financial industry, I'm going to ignore the other taxes and focus on the VAT. I'm also going to limit this rough analysis to first-order effects, so I won't assume any economic growth will be stimulated. In line with Yang's plan, I'll assume that a VAT and savings on existing welfare programs can make roughly equal contributions.\nI'll keep the $1000 per month amount (for simplicity, I'm not going to limit it to 18+, though), as I figure this is enough to live frugally on in New Brunswick. Single adults would probably need to find a roommate, but if they did, there are plenty of apartments in the $700 – $1000 per month range (a third to a half of the income a UBI would provide).\nHow much would this cost? The population of New Brunswick is 770,633. Rounding to 750,000, we're looking at:\n$9 billion dollars ($9000M—to facilitate comparisons between different magnitudes, I'm going to try to keep as much as possible in millions of dollars) is almost equal to the entire provincial budget ($9823M). That means that revenues (including savings found elsewhere) would need to pretty much double what they are now (actually, more than that, since over 20% of the provincial revenue comes from equalization payments). Looked at another way, the provincial GDP of NB is $36,088M ($47,060 per capita) so a UBI would involve 25% of it. These numbers are far from trivial!\nThe first thing to realize is that taxing the rich would not pay for such a grandiose program. No one is hiding a stash like that! The richest family in NB, the Irvings, have a net wealth of $8230M. Next is Harrison McCain with $3790M, and the third-richest isn't even a billionaire. Even in the extreme case of a 100% wealth tax (i.e. outright confiscation*), the Irving fortune—which took a century to build up—would be burned through in less than a year of funding a UBI. McCain could cover the next five months. Note that this isn't unique to New Brunswick: Washington State has ten times the population and the two richest people in the world; Jeff Bezos could fund a UBI there for 1 year and 8 months, then Bill Gates could take over for the next year.\n*Hard assets like factories are difficult to convert into cash quickly, and it would be especially challenging to find a buyer as a jurisdiction with a 100% wealth tax, so the actual proceeds from such a move would be way lower than I'm using in this example\nTo further emphasize this point, let's consider the entire 1% (around 7500 people in NB). Obviously I don't know their cumulative wealth, but I think I can use a model to estimate the order of magnitude. Zipf's law is often used to model size vs rank relationships. It says that (under the conditions where it is valid, which could plausibly apply to long-tailed wealth distributions) the nth entry in a list will be 1/n the size of the first entry. We saw above that the McCain fortune was about half the size of the Irving fortune (the next entry is less than 1/8, so Zipf's law might be providing an over-estimate here) so at least the first two entries follow this pattern. This model would also imply that the last person in the 1% of NB has a net wealth of $8230M/7500 = $1.1 million. Across Canada, there are 1.3 million millionaires (3.5% of the population) but there are only 376,700 millionaires (1% of the population) if you use the US dollar (i.e. $1.33M Canadian) rather than the Canadian dollar as the cutoff. So it seems plausible for the threshold to be part of the 1% in New Brunswick to be a bit lower (since a lot of Canadian millionaires are simply people who own houses in Toronto or Vancouver).\nStarting from the Irvings covering 1 year, McCain 1/2 a year, the next person 1/3 of a year, and so on, I used Clojure to take the sum of the series for 7500 people:\nSo the wealth of the 1% could cover a provincial UBI for less than 10 years. Considering it would cost $1M per hour, once we're out of millionaires, it won't take long to burn through everyone else's wealth (extending the above calculation to the top 2% (15000 people) only extends the timeline to 10.2 years).\nTo conclude this section, a program as broad-based as a UBI basically requires an equally broad base of funding. That's why the next section will consider a value-added tax (VAT).\nThe HST that we already have is a VAT (more or less). This makes it easier to do a rough analysis of how much it would need to be increased to finance a UBI compared to estimating the revenue a brand new tax might raise. The HST rate is 15%, split between 10% to the province and 5% to the federal government. It currently brings in $1539M, or $154M per percentage point. At the 10% rate that goes to the provincial government, 4.3% of the total provincial GDP is captured; it's not a 1:1 relationship as not all economic activity falls under the purview of a VAT. Note that Yang's plan similarly expects to raise 4.2% of GDP ($800 billion out of the $19 trillion US economy) at a rate of 10%. The difference is that the proceeds of the HST are already spoken for in NB, so it would have to be raised a lot more to pay for a UBI. How much?\nAssuming an equal mix of new revenue and savings from winding down other income-support programs (the latter point will be explored further below), the HST must bring in an additional $4500M. Assuming the revenue increases linearly with the rate (also discussed below), this equates to:\nSo 29 percentage points would need to be added to the HST, taking it from the current 15% to a new rate of 44%. What would this look like?\nA $2 cup of coffee is currently $2.30 after tax. It would be $2.88 after tax at the new rate. Or, if you went car shopping with a budget of $30,000 you could currently afford a $26,000 car before tax but at the new rate would only be able to afford a $21,000 car before tax. The HST would go from being 13% of the final price to 31% of the final price.\nConsider a household (assume 3 people) at the median income of $59,347. If they spend 40% of their income on things within the purview of the HST, they are currently paying $3,100 annually in HST. If each member of the household receives a UBI of $1000 per month, their new income is $95,347 (provided they keep working their existing jobs). If this increase (in addition to previous spending habits) all goes into things that are within the purview of the HST, they'll be paying $18,500 in HST at the new rate. This extra $15,400 in revenue from the median household is a bit shy of half (43%) of what they gain from the UBI. Poorer households (who will spend more on essentials like rent and groceries that are exempt from HST) will have less clawed back and richer houses (if they are spending more) will have more clawed back. As I mentioned above, a program as broad-based as a UBI basically requires an equally broad base of funding and here we see that a middle class household would indeed be paying close to the average amount of tax needed to cover the program (since half of the UBI is intended to be covered by taxes and half by savings).\nMoving on to the savings side of the equation, here are some potential sources:\nMost of the above programs are federal, but just as the HST is administered by the federal government and the appropriate amount is transferred to the province, I'm sure an arrangement could be worked out to transfer applicable savings if a UBI was implemented.\nHowever, the amount of savings from wrapping the above programs into a UBI fall far short of the amount assumed (i.e. for the savings to cover an equal amount as the VAT). The current provincial spending on income support is practically negligible compared to the size of a UBI. For some children and seniors, there may be programs that could be wrapped up to cover about half of their UBI with the savings, but these programs are means-tested, so they don't even cover all children and seniors. For working adults we're left with EI as a source of savings. The premiums are a maximum of $2064 per year per employee (split between the employee and the employer)—this would cover only 17% of the UBI rather than the necessary 50%.\nThis part of the analysis implies that the HST would need to be raised even more than calculated above.\nIn my opinion, a VAT is more logical for funding a UBI than other forms of taxation. Since a UBI is often proposed in the context of forecasts of high unemployment due to automation, an income tax would be a bad idea to fund it since the number of people with income to report would be low. And as I've discussed, a very broad-based source of funding is necessary for such a grandiose program. A VAT is straight-forward to administer and hard to evade (even people working under the table still spend most of their money in legitimate stores). Also, since essentials like groceries are exempt (and maybe utility bills should be added to the exemption), it doesn't have to be a big burden to the poor.\nThis is good point to discuss tax avoidance, however. While tax evasion involves finding ways to not pay tax that you owe, tax avoidance simply involves altering your behaviour so that you owe less tax. There isn't a legal (or moral) case against doing so. Some taxes (e.g. carbon tax, cigarette tax) are explicitly intended to alter behaviour, but the incentive to change what you're doing is there whether it's the intended effect or a side effect of a tax. A 44% HST is very high. I found Copenhagen to be an expensive city when I was there last year, which I think was partly because Denmark has a 25% VAT. At a substantially higher rate than that, it's not hard to imagine people making significant changes in their spending habits (e.g. waiting to buy clothes and electronics on cross-border shopping trips, living as a snowbird for several months—but not so long as to lose residency and the UBI). These types of behavioural changes mean that the revenue generated by a tax increase will not increase linearly with the tax rate, as I assumed in my analysis above for simplification (this phenomenon is the Laffer curve).\nOf course, Yang's UBI plan for the US has a much-easier-to-swallow VAT rate of 10%. I think this points to a big difference between Canada and the US. Here in Canada (at least in most provinces), all the \"low hanging fruit\" of potential tax revenue has already been picked. We have a national VAT (i.e. the HST), we have a carbon tax—we even pay taxes on our taxes (since the HST is applied to the carbon tax). This puts a lot more constraints on thinking of ways to fund bold new programs in Canada, while in the US it can at least be imagined.\nBefore moving on to the final section of this post, I want to reiterate that I didn't assume that the UBI would stimulate (or dampen) the economy, whereas it is a significant part of Yang's plan.\nSomething as large-scale as a universal basic income is almost certain to have a big impact on the overall economy. By necessity, I didn't consider any second-order effects in the analysis above or it would have gotten way too complicated. We can only speculate about what kinds of effects these might be, but some that come to mind include:\nAs I said, these are only speculation. But whatever effects do occur, they'll cause additional effects from the interactions between them. That makes the kind of analysis above a very rudimentary starting point.\nThere have been some attempts to study the impacts of a UBI, but they have mostly been small in scale and focused more on how it affects individual recipients. One of the big concerns I have about it is that some potential complex large-scale interaction effects with unforeseeable consequences might be dependent on it being universal—not the sort of thing that can be detected by pilot studies. Politically, a UBI would be almost impossible to cancel (who will vote to stop getting a cheque for $1000 per month) and I've always been a big believer in being very cautious about getting into a situation that you know will be hard to get out of. At the very least, any UBI should be designed with feedback loops that limit its growth rather than magnify it (e.g. index it to the amount of money raised by the VAT not to inflation).\nPermalink",

    "content": "Recently I read a few journal articles analyzing some historical instances of irrigation. My notes and some thoughts are shared below.\nThe first article was \"Rome and Agriculture in Africa Proconsularis: Land and Hydraulic Development\" by Arbia Hilali in Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire (2013). It gives a high-level overview of the development of agricultural lands in North Africa after Rome conquered it from Carthage. Hilali writes that,\nThe Romans were soon making their mark on the African landscape through the creation of a road network, the establishment of centuriation and the development of cultivation in terraces\nAs simple as it seems, terracing is a form of hydraulic infrastructure:\nThe objective of such an arrangement was to slow down the flow of water in order to retain it as long as possible, to avoid erosion, and to enrich the arable land through the accumulation of transported alluvium, which regenerates the fertility of the cultivable layer of soil.\nA book I read a couple of years ago called Thirst had a fair bit to say about the use of terracing by ancient civilizations around the world.\nCenturiation was a term I hadn't heard before. It refers to the Roman system of land surveying and division:\nthe aims of these surveying operations were to divide up the land, to specify the borders and the rights of the owners, to signal the quality of the land, (uncultivated land was not registered) and to fix fiscal norms and thus create a \"fiscal space\".\nTo the point about creating a \"fiscal space\", I'm reminded an insight that I think I gleaned from the book Free Market Environmentalism that property rights are legal infrastructure, and just like physical infrastructure it takes work to create and maintain them. Although I can't find the passage I'm thinking of, the next paper I read cited a different work by one of the same authors (Terry Anderson) with the following statement:\nStudies of arrangements governing property in the frontier west have identified how better specified property rights tend to emerge as increasing scarcity transforms the situation from one of de facto open access to one where increasingly well-specified property rights bear returns that outweigh the costs of such rights' creation and enforcement.\nAccording to the paper, some traces of centuriation can still be seen in Tunisia, such as in the hills around Mateur (near Lac Ichkeul). I find it interesting just how persistent original land surveys can be. There are some examples in Canada—not nearly as long-lived as these Roman ones, of course—that can be clearly seen on aerial photos that I thought I'd share:\nHilali's paper refers to records of land sales in Roman Africa, noting that,\nthe bills [of sale] of specify that the land was sold along with channels or reservoirs, which permitted cultivation\nOn a larger scale, the paper states:\nit became clear that water and the construction of aquaducts are one of the key factors in the development of specific small areas.\nReturning to the policy environment, Hilali describes how the Lex Manciana provided legal incentives to settle marginal land:\nThese regulations envisage conditions of tenancy for land that was not included in the centuriation lines and which was described as subseciva, owing to its uncultivated character (mountain, steppe and semi-desert areas).\nPeasant farmers in such areas benefited from favourable conditions, being obliged to pay only a third of their crop to the landowners.\nIn addition to property rights and infrastructure (from aqueducts to field-scale irrigation channels), an important consideration for agricultural development in Roman Africa was the way it was tied into the markets and trade routes of the empire:\nnorth Africa was one of the most dynamic regions of the Roman Empire and a source of exports, whether to Rome or to other provinces.\nThese factors (i.e. agricultural land is more valuable when it is surveyed (with the accompanying property rights), has infrastructure, and has access to markets) are summarized in the conclusion:\nThe topographic and hydraulic arrangements in Africa Proconsularis fit into an agricultural program. They reflect a deliberate policy to increase agricultural cultivation that formed the heart of a dynamic colonization scheme. ... agricultural cultivation was linked both to environmental considerations and to fiscal and legal incentives. ... The division of present-day parcels has retained much of the subdivisions of centuriae. ... By surveying the territories and transforming the agricultural landscape, the Romans succeeded in incorporating some African agricultural products in Mediterranean commercial circuits\nThe mention of Mediterranean agricultural products reminded me of a great museum I went to in Marseille called MuCEM.\nThe next paper looks at the effect on developing irrigation infrastructure when two factors—access to markets and clear title—come into conflict. It is titled \"Development Derailed: Railroad Land Grants and Irrigation in the Western United States\" and the authors are Eric Alston and Steven Smith (2019). The copy I read notes that it is a conference draft and not for general citation or circulation (hopefully something as informal as a blog post is okay); I don't know if it has been presented or published anywhere yet.\nThe topic of investigation was to:\nexamine the effects of uncertainty to title* on one costly economic activity along the frontier, irrigation development.\n*this inspired the title of this post\nNineteenth-century railroads in the Western US raised the value of agricultural land by providing access to markets, but they were given entitlements to some of the land along their routes, which kept it in legal limbo until the railroad was constructed. The authors selected a railroad in Montana (the Northern Pacific = NP) that took a long time to complete (at a time when political and legal controversy over land grants to railroads was growing) as a case study to investigate the effect of uncertainty over (eventual) ownership on investment in improvements to the land. Specifically, irrigation works were considered as the improvement of interest, since irrigation is important for agricultural productivity in arid regions of the Western US like Montana, and because careful records were kept of irrigation diversions as higher-priority water rights went to early users under the prior appropriation rule.\nThe following excerpts explain the background of this case study that I've tried to summarize in the preceding paragraph:\nBetween 1850 and 1871, the federal government (and Texas) authorized the transfer of 158 million acres to private railroad companies. ... Upon certification of completion of a twenty-five mile section, the Land Office would issue patents for the odd-numbered sections of public lands lying on either side of the railroad right-of-way. (emphasis added)\nThe dominant paths to land title in the West [for individual settlers] were Homestead, Cash-Sales, and direct purchase from Railroads. ... But for the settler arriving in Montana between 1864 and, at minimum, 1894, it was unclear if any path to title would constitute a valid title on odd-sections within the land grant. If one was to pre-emptively purchase a parcel from the railroad before the NP received a patent, the settler took on the risk that the NP, having violated the terms of the land grant, would never receive a patent. Settling under the Homestead Act or a cash-sale from the government was an equally dubious proposition as the NP could ultimately argue the land had been reserved in the grant.\ncertainty to land title is an input to costly irrigation development because irrigation ditches are highly idiosyncratic investments given that the construction costs are sunk, location is important, and the ditch cannot be used for anything else\npersistent difficulties in construction of the Northern Pacific and changes in General Land Office practices led to a large amount of lands being nominally withheld from settlement, which we argue had a persistent impact on the extent of irrigation in the state of Montana.\nThus, the comparative development of railroads and land policy in Montana and Colorado from 1864 to around 1920 provides a rich environment in which to test the effects of the interaction of land policy, ownership uncertainty, and railroad construction on irrigation development outcomes.\nBy giving railroads legal title to some of the parcels of land along their routes, the US government of the latter half of the 19th century provided an incentive for private companies to build infrastructure that didn't require a large outlay of money from the public treasury. The railroad companies would normally sell their parcels—which had increased in value since they now had good access to transportation—to recover construction costs. Although the government also benefitted from an increased tax base (as the railroads increased property values), these land grant subsidies were seen as overly-generous and became politically controversial. Alston and Smith also mention a scandal that increased the political controversy (In Canada, John A. MacDonald also had a scandal over railway financing).\nIn this political environment, and with delays in its construction, it was uncertain whether the Northern Pacific (NP) would get its land grants. The authors decided to use this uncertainty to test the economic theory that clear title/rights makes owners more likely to invest in improvements to a property:\nOur main hypothesis is that the uncertainty surrounding the NP land grants in Montana suppressed investment in irrigation – a costly and asset-specific investment nearly necessary for agriculture in the region.\nAlston and Smith use this case study as a clever natural experiment. As mentioned above, railroads in the western United States were given part of the land (odd-number parcels within a certain distance from the tracks) along their routes as an incentive for development. However, construction delays and a changing political environment made it unclear whether the Northern Pacific in Montana would benefit from this policy to the same extent. The authors were able to compare it to a railroad in Colorado that was finished on schedule (and before the land grants became controversial) and to another railroad in Montana that was built without subsidies.\nThey did some statistical analyses to investigate their hypothesis. One of these was a regression analysis looking at which factors about a PLSS parcel location (e.g. distance from a railroad, whether it was an odd-numbered section, etc.) explain variance in how much was irrigated and how early. Some of the key results are as follows:\nland within the railroad grants in Montana have considerably smaller portions brought under irrigation by 1919 while Colorado land within its railroad grants were much more likely to have larger shares irrigated.\nand,\nwater rights tend to be 4.3 years later within the railroad grant in Montana than the land beyond it. As a point of contrast, irrigation occurred nearly 8 years earlier on [railroad] land grant areas in Colorado\nThese two results are pretty convincing, in my opinion. Alston and Smith also emphasize that the date of first irrigation is carefully tracked because that establishes the priority/precedence of the water right under the prior appropriation rule, giving them reliable data to work with.\nAnother part of their analysis used the regression discontinuity method which they explain as follows:\nThe regression discontinuity method assumes that, other than change in policy imposed by the distance, the land on either side of the cutoff is similar along other dimensions.\nBasically, parcels that are 51 miles from a railroad and parcels that are 49 miles from a railroad should be the same in almost every respect except the different policies that apply on either side of a 50 mile buffer (i.e. whether they are part of the potential land grant sections to the railroad). This threshold provides a natural opportunity to consider the impact of the policy environment while holding other factors constant.\nI'm including a figure from their paper here for discussion purposes:\nIn their words, the analysis shows that,\nThere appears a stark change at the border and actual irrigation investment occurs years earlier just beyond the railroad grant lands in Montana.\nThis result lines up with the results of the previous analysis. To further solidify their findings, Alston and Smith did placebo tests at a different distance from the NT (where no legal change in status was applicable), at the same distance from the Great Northern (which had no land grants), and at the edge of the grant band of a railroad in Colorado (which didn't have the same uncertainty plaguing it). There did not appear to be a significant impact from the placebos, so they conclude that,\nIn sum, our tests provide a variety of evidence supportive of our general hypothesis: uncertainty surrounding railroad land grants in Montana had a persistent and negative influence on the extent and timing of irrigation development in the state.\nThis draft paper is very long; even with all of the excerpts and summarizing I've included above I've only touched on the highlights. Hopefully it can be made more concise for publication. I was very impressed by the mustering of data and the statistical analyses, especially the fact that they included placebo/robustness checks to make sure that they wouldn't get results that were just as significant in places where their hypothesis didn't apply as where it did.\nBefore moving on to the final paper I'll be discussing in this post, there are just a few more things from Alston and Smith's paper I wanted to note:\nFrontiers necessarily implicate questions of institutional change as private ordering is supplanted by a public legal system\nThe final paper I'm reviewing in this post is \"Cooperation, Games, and Ecological Feedback: Some Insights from Bali\" by J. Stephen Lansing & John H. Miller.\nJohn Miller wrote one of the books on complexity I reviewed last year (and he discussed this paper in it).\nEach of the papers I've looked at in this post is based in a different location and timeframe. The first one was in north Africa during Roman times, the second was in the American West in the late 19th century, and this one is in Bali and considers practices that likely developed over centuries but are still extant.\nAs Lansing and Miller describe it, rice farming in Bali faces two major challenges: there isn't enough water for the peak demand of all the farmers, and a variety of pests can consume a significant fraction of the harvest if their populations aren't checked. However,\nWithout centralized control, farmers have created a carefully coordinated system that allows productive farming in an ecosystem that is rife with water scarcity and the threat of disease and pests. ... the ecology of the rice farming system links these two externalities in such a way that cooperation, rather than chaos, results.\nThe water supply limitation can be mitigated by staggered planting (so one farmer's peak water demands will coincide with another's minimum water demands) while the pest threat can be mitigated by simultaneous planting (since pest populations will starve if fallow periods in nearby fields all occur at once).\nThe authors explain these conflicting goals:\nIf farmers with adjacent fields can synchronize their cropping periods to create a uniform fallow period over a sufficiently large area, rice pests are temporarily deprived of their habitat and populations can be sharply reduced.\nOf course, if too many farmers follow an identical cropping pattern in an effort to control pests, then peak water demands will coincide. The existing watershed often does not have sufficient water to meet the full needs of all farmers in such a case.\nFrom these considerations, they develop a game theory matrix, which I've included a copy of here (along with a couple of other figures from the paper that I'll be referring to below) for discussion purposes.\nIn this matrix, δ is the normalized crop loss to the downstream farmer due to reduced water and ρ is the crop loss from pests (affects both downstream and upstream farmers). A and B are choices of planting times and the subscripts d and u represent the downstream and upstream farmers, respectively. A full rice harvest with no impact from pests or water shortage is normalized to 1. Each cell contains the upstream farmer's harvest followed by the downstream farmer's harvest, separated by a comma.\nThe authors explain the implications of this matrix:\nThe expected aggregate crop yield from the mixed strategy is 2 - δ/2 - ρ. Two pure strategy equilibria (either both planting at time A or both planting at time B) arise when δ ≤ ρ.\nA Nash equilibrium is when \"no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy.\" That is, a vertical or horizontal move in the above matrix won't make either farmer better off under the conditions that Lansing and Miller state. However, under certain conditions (specifically when δ/2 < ρ < δ), the aggregate harvest (the sum of each farmer's harvest) could get better under certain conditions that would leave one of the farmers worse off—and therefore isn't a strategic equilibria. This leads to the theoretical outcome where cooperation is induced when damage from pests increases past a certain point:\nIf pest losses are low, the downstream farmer wants to stagger cropping due to water considerations while the upstream farmer wants to plant simultaneously to avoid pest damage ... If, however, pest losses are high, both farmers' incentives are to coordinate\nthe downstream farmer has no incentive to incorporate the pest damage to the upstream field in his decision calculus, and therefore it is possible for the downstream farmer to prefer staggered cropping even though this lowers aggregate yield.\nOn the other hand, it might be possible for the two farmers to come to a agreement where the upstream farmer passes on more water in exchange for the downstream farmer cooperating in controlling pests:\nthere are circumstances in which the upstream farmer may be willing to pass on some of the water in order to induce the downstream farmer to cooperate.\n(I think the Coase theorem would have been very relevant to cite here)\nThey suggest that when farmers are motivated to cooperate (either outright or with some sharing of water), the local network of water temples provides a mechanism for arranging coordinated planting schedules.\nThe game theory model is a simple one (but sometimes simple models can be the most useful in reducing a phenomenon to its most salient points) so they move on to supporting that portion of the analysis with 3 lines of evidence. First was a \"natural experiment\" when a government mandate to grow more rice disrupted the traditional practice of local temples deciding planting schedules; next was an artificial experiment involving a detailed simulation of rice harvests in a district in which the authors tweaked the pest aggressiveness parameter; and last was a survey of farmers to see which ones were more concerned about pests and which ones were more concerned about water scarcity.\nThe natural experiment (i.e. not planned by the authors but a time in the historical record when a single factor was changed) took place during the Green Revolution in the 1970s. The government wanted to increase the agricultural output of the country. Here is how Lansing and Miller describe it:\nTo accomplish such a rapid change, the government legally mandated the double- and triple-cropping of these new [high-yield] varieties of rice. This led to the abandonment of the temple system of irrigation control, and therefore produced a situation where the previous coordination mechanism was rendered ineffective.\nSoon after these mandated changes, district agricultural offices began to report \"chaos in the water scheduling\" and \"explosions of pest populations\"\nThe natural experiment of the breakdown of coordination during the Green Revolution provides support for the importance of coordination mechanisms in this system. The ecosystem is such that without careful coordination it experiences massive crop losses, and ultimately lower aggregate output, due to exploding pest populations. This resulted in strong pressure from the farmers to re-institute coordination mechanisms despite resistance from consultants and officials supporting the modernization program.\nThe simulation results used in the artificial experiment and some of the survey results are included in the image I shared above. In the simulation model, each subak (a group of farmers) in the model copies the best of its four neighbours for its cropping pattern in the following year (this seems reminiscent of cellular automata rules); the model also includes hydrological (water availability) and biological (growth of rice and pests) components. In Figure 4, planting times become more coordinated (shown with clusters of subaks all having the same symbol) between neighbours as pest damage increase (from left to right). In Figure 6, survey results from paired upstream/downstream subaks show a higher relative concern over pests in upstream subaks and a higher relative concern over water shortages in downstream subaks. Both of these results line up with the strategic considerations from the game theory model.\nHere is how Lansing and Miller conclude:\nWithout centralized control, farmers have created a coordinated system that allows productive farming in an ecosystem that is rife with water scarcity and the threat of disease and pests. The game-theoretic model we develop above, inspired by a generation of extensive anthropological field work*, provides a compact explanation for many of the most salient features we observe in the system.\nWhile externalities caused by either water scarcity or pests, would, in isolation, be expected to imply a serious failure, the ecology of the rice farming system links these two externalities in such a way that cooperation, rather than catastrophe, is the result.\n*we should all be so lucky to have field work in Bali.\nOverall, I thought this was a very good paper. I feel like I understand game theory a bit better after seeing this application that is a step up in complexity from the regular example of the Prisoners' Dilemma. Validating the strategic insights of the game theory analysis with three distinct avenues of evidence (a historical disruption used as a natural experiment, a more complex simulation, and field surveys) strengthens their results a great deal. The account of pest populations ballooning during the Green Revolution is a good reminder that local knowledge shouldn't be too quickly ignored by experts.\nFor one of my next posts, I think I might have more to say about this last point (and also have more to say about Coase, who I briefly mentioned in the above discussion).\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is a short post about a simple device I tried making for measuring the velocity of water.\nA pitot tube is a device for converting a fluid velocity to a pressure (which is easier to measure). Recall from this post that velocity is one of the components of the energy of a fluid. A tube with a bend in it that stagnates the velocity converts that energy to height, with the relationship h = v2/(2g).\nUsing some copper pipe I had left over from a previous project, along with a wooden dowel and a length of vinyl tubing, I tried making a pitot tube. The following image shows the assembled apparatus as well as using it to take a measurement.\nThe water level in the vinyl tubing has risen around 2 cm. That equates to a velocity of 0.63 metres per second (2 ft/sec). Looking at what it would take to reach higher levels, 5 cm equates to a velocity of 1 m/s, 10 cm is 1.4 m/s, 15 cm is 1.7 m/s, and 20 cm is 2 m/s.\nI didn't have a way to cross-check the velocity measurement, but I felt like the pitot tube reading was on the low side. Placing the pitot tube into the flow created turbulence in its immediate vicinity, altering the local velocities from what they were before it was inserted into the stream*. One way to mitigate this might be to use a longer length of tube facing into the stream (before the elbow).\n*Taken more generally, the fact that attempting to measure a process inevitably affects it is a fundamental issue in physics and other fields.\nTo test my pitot tube, I biked to a suitable spot along the Nashwaak River in Marysville (actually, I went as far as an old train bridge to enjoy the ride and the view). This is one of my recommended activities for people to do in Fredericton, NB. There is a nice view along this trail of the old cotton mill in Marysville and the remains of the dam that powered it.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a brief follow-up to the one I wrote earlier this year about trying to make a hydraulic computer.\nOne of the key elements of the hydraulic computer I tried to build was a set of AND gates, built \"using a siphon and a slow drain\" per a paper I found. Because I made these components by hand, they didn't have a consistent amount of water that would trigger the siphon. To address this issue, I designed a version that could be 3d printed so that each one would be the same.\nHere is a cross-section of the Sketch-Up model I made:\nAs long as the main chamber is only half full or less, it will slowly drain out the hole in the bottom. But if enough water is added, the siphon will start flowing and send most of the water out the larger hole. At least that's the theory.\nI had two of these units printed from 3DHubs (described here). They were not water- or air-tight at first, so they leaked out of the bottom in more places than just the drain hole, and the siphon wouldn't hold. Additionally, there was some support scaffolding printed inside the siphon tube that decreased its flow rate a bit.\nTo address the leaks, I painted them with acrylic paint. This did allow it to flow through the siphon (as seen in the unit on the right in the image below) but it hasn't quite achieved the consistent performance I'm looking for.\nIdeally, the ratio of the diameters of the small drain hole and the siphon would be such that they would discharge equal volumes so that the unit could be set up to input flow to other logic gates in series.\nIn the hydraulic computer I tried to build, the distribution of flow between the test cups (i.e. AND gates) was a bigger problem than their performance, so even if I had reliable, repeatable performance from this component, the overall system wouldn't work together as intended yet.\nIf you'd like to try printing one of these AND gates or improving the design, it's available for download on Thingiverse.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I usually only write reviews of non-fiction books that I read but a novel I read recently was different enough from typical fiction that I thought I'd make an exception.\nThe Years of Rice and Salt, by Kim Stanley Robinson, is an alternate history novel. It starts with a world in which Europe was almost entirely wiped out by the black plague and then imagines how things develop from there. Most of the story takes place in Asia, which is mostly divided between the Islamic world and China. As in real history, the former spends most of the time split into a bunch of different polities (not necessarily hostile, just not having effective centralized power) while the latter spends most of the time as a unified empire (with varying degrees of acceptance of that unity in the provinces). As people start to resettle Europe and make contact with the Americas, some of the story takes place in those continents as well.\nThe story has a huge scope not only in the geography it covers, but also in the time that it spans (as I've alluded to in the title of this post). This means that telling the story takes much more than the lifetime of any single character. Maintaining narrative continuity over so long of a timeline is a challenge for authors. Thinking about this challenge was actually what prompted writing this review. In Isaac Asimov's Foundation, for example, episodes separated by decades are linked by the device of psychohistory: pre-recorded hologram messages from Hari Seldon are played back at the determined times where he shares his advice on the challenges the characters are currently facing based on the forecasts made by his grand model of history. Another novel I'm currently reading, A Canticle for Leibowitz has a wandering Jew character who shows up in sections of the book that are centuries apart. The device that The Years of Rice and Salt uses to connect episodes separated by generations is reincarnation. As Wikipedia notes, the reincarnated characters have names that start with the same letter. They also have some broad similarities in personality (but not to the extent that they're the same character just with a new name) and occasionally have a sense of deja vu (usually when meeting the reincarnation of an old friend). In my opinion, this plot device succeeded in making the novel cohesive when it could otherwise feel like a series of unrelated stories set in the same fictional world. However, knowing in advance that the characters were going to get reincarnated (after the pattern was established in the first couple of sections) made it hard to care what happened to any of them.\nThe strength of The Years of Rice and Salt is the worldbuilding. It was especially interesting to see how real developments like the discovery of the New World and the scientific revolution happened. My favourite section was Book Four. It is set in Samarqand on the Silk Road. In Robinson's alternate history it is there that the scientific revolution begins. An alchemist and his friend decide to start testing everything instead of trusting the authority of old books. Seeing so many advances compressed into the output of a single lab (although men like Galileo, Huygens, and Newton would not have been too far behind these fictional proto-scientists in their research productivity) helps one appreciate just how ground-breaking the scientific revolution was in the real world. I liked this depiction of the incremental nature of the scientific revolution (or the industrial revolution—I can't remember which section I saved this quote from):\nEvery time the old artisans were able to make their molds and tools more exactly, it allowed them to set their tolerances finer still, and thus as they progressed, anything from the intricacies of clockwork to the massive strength of waterwheels or cannon barrels could be improved.\nBy Book 9, the second-last section, technology has advanced to a similar level to the twentieth century. Global communication and wide-spread literacy allow Robinson to summarize and review previous events without breaking the fourth wall. For example, books written by characters in previous sections of the novel (in various countries and languages) are referenced and discussed by characters in this section. There is even a boulevard named after a character in Book 2 in the main city in this section. A scientific conference has the official languages of Persian, Chinese, Tamil, Arabic, and Algonquin, reminding readers where the powerful states have developed in this alternate history. Little touches like this, along with the plot device of reincarnation, help to tie the book together.\nOverall, this was an interesting book, especially due to the worldbuilding and ideas it raises: good alternate histories make you think about what would have been different and what would have been the same (e.g. a world without Europe is not a world without war or colonialism) under different circumstances. But if you want a novel where you feel invested in the characters, this is not the one.\nMostly unrelated to the main part of this post (although it does come at things from a historical perspective), a political essay I read this week was thought-provoking enough to share. It asks the question whether national unity is always a good thing or whether it overlaps enough with nationalism to be dangerous. Here's a brief excerpt:\nBut note how the argument here is instrumental or utilitarian, not aesthetic, psychological, or philosophical. We need to unify to get X done. In other words, unity is a tool, a means to an end, not a good in itself. Fire is a tool that can be used for good or evil. Unity is the political equivalent of fire — a source of power. ...\nSo here’s the thing: That means unity is only as good or bad as the goal you want to attain with it. No one likes a good heist movie more than I do. The gang gets together to rob a bank or casino, and they pull it off by sticking together. But all reasonable people understand that in the real world, that’s an immoral goal (hypotheticals about ripping off bad guys — gotta love Kelly’s Heroes! — notwithstanding).\nPermalink",

    "content": "For the Easter weekend I have some thoughts to share about a passage in the Bible that doesn't get a ton of attention.\nBut Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord took his life. Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother’s wife, he wasted his seed on the ground in order not to give offspring to his brother. But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord; so He took his life also. (Genesis 38:7–10)\nThe preceding account of Onan is often taken to be a condemnation of non-procreative sexual acts and/or birth control. However, I think there's more to the story that we can learn from. Using the principle that scripture interprets scripture, we'll start by looking at the context of this account then contrast it with a similar situation that turned out a lot differently.\nReading the full chapter of Genesis 38 we notice that the woman in the verses above has a name—Tamar—and she is one of the main characters of the chapter, along with Onan's father Judah. To summarize the events of the chapter, Judah (a great-grandson of Abraham and the ancestor of one of the twelve tribes of Israel) has 3 sons. The oldest is Er, who marries Tamar but is struck down by God (for unspecified wickedness) before they have any children. The custom in that culture was that a widow's husband's brother was supposed to take care of her; this included being sexually intimate with the expectation that any children she had would carry on the line (including inheriting property) of the deceased brother. Onan is the second son of Judah and has this responsibility. It doesn't go well, as we've seen above. Judah has one more son but he's afraid that that one will end up getting smitten too, so he keeps putting off matching him with Tamar. Eventually she gets tired of waiting. Being a widow with no children would leave her pretty isolated and without support in that culture. She disguises herself as a prostitute associated with a local fertility cult and hangs out by a road that she knows Judah will be travelling on. Not knowing it's his daughter-in-law and being a widower himself by this time he uses her services and agrees to send payment (a goat), leaving some personal effects as a security deposit until then. When she gets pregnant and is going to be punished for being an unchaste widow she uses the personal effects to reveal that Judah is the father. The chapter ends with Tamar giving birth to twins, with Perez being the firstborn and the senior male heir of Judah by the rules of inheritance.\nWho is Judah? He was the fourth son of Jacob (by his wife Leah). However, his older brothers dishonoured the family: Reuben got caught sleeping with his father's concubine and Simeon and Levi massacred a village after their sister was raped. Because of these things, when Jacob was giving his final blessing to his family before he died, Judah got the preeminent place:\n“Judah, your brothers shall praise you;\nYour hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;\nYour father’s sons shall bow down to you.\n“Judah is a lion’s whelp;\nFrom the prey, my son, you have gone up.\nHe couches, he lies down as a lion,\nAnd as a lion, who dares rouse him up?\n“The scepter shall not depart from Judah,\nNor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,\nUntil Shiloh comes,\nAnd to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.\n“He ties his foal to the vine,\nAnd his donkey’s colt to the choice vine;\nHe washes his garments in wine,\nAnd his robes in the blood of grapes.\n“His eyes are dull from wine,\nAnd his teeth white from milk. (Genesis 49:8–12, emphasis added).\nSo Judah is the prophesied ancestor of royalty.\nIn spite of the position and promises he has, Judah's character in Genesis 38 is not exemplary. The way he looks for a wife doesn't follow his father and grandfather's examples of family loyalty. He doesn't treat Tamar justly. He goes to a prostitute. But at the end of the story when Tamar confronts him that he is the father of her unborn children he admits she was in the right; he goes on to accept Perez as his heir.\nTo further illuminate this account, I want to contrast it with that of Ruth and Boaz:\n[Ruth's] mother-in-law then said to her, “Where did you glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the Lord who has not withdrawn his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Again Naomi said to her, “The man is our relative, he is one of our closest relatives.” Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “Furthermore, he said to me, ‘You should stay close to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.’” Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maids, so that others do not fall upon you in another field.” So she stayed close by the maids of Boaz in order to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.\nThen Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek security for you, that it may be well with you? Now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maids you were? Behold, he winnows barley at the threshing floor tonight. Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself and put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. It shall be when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies, and you shall go and uncover his feet and lie down; then he will tell you what you shall do.” She said to her, “All that you say I will do.”\nSo she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her. When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. It happened in the middle of the night that the man was startled and bent forward; and behold, a woman was lying at his feet. He said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. So spread your covering over your maid, for you are a close relative.” Then he said, “May you be blessed of the Lord, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the first by not going after young men, whether poor or rich. Now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. Now it is true I am a close relative; however, there is a relative closer than I. Remain this night, and when morning comes, if he will redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then I will redeem you, as the Lord lives. Lie down until morning.”\nSo she lay at his feet until morning and rose before one could recognize another; and he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” Again he said, “Give me the cloak that is on you and hold it.” So she held it, and he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went into the city. When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And she told her all that the man had done for her. She said, “These six measures of barley he gave to me, for he said, ‘Do not go to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.” (Ruth 2:19 – 3:18, emphasis added)\nRuth was married to one of Naomi's sons but he passed away so she is a widow. The two women have returned to Naomi's home village of Bethlehem. The social safety net of that time was that landowners weren't supposed to make a second pass of their fields during the harvest; any grain that got missed during the first pass was left behind for people in need to come pick, a process called gleaning. As a childless widow, Ruth is in a position where she needs to glean to have enough food for herself and her mother-in-law. In the centuries that have passed since the time of Tamar it seems that the practices around re-marrying widows have been expanded and formalized. It no longer has to be done by a brother of the deceased husband, but can be any near relative. Additionally, the property of the deceased is supposed to go to the one who marries the widow, since the offspring would be counted as heirs of the deceased—it was important in the Old Testament to keep property in the family.\nThe practice of buying back property and raising up heirs for branches of the family tree that would otherwise come to a dead end when someone was widowed was known as \"redemption\". In the account above, Boaz plays the role of the redeemer, keeping alive the name and inheritance of the deceased. Even before he does so, he's described as showing kindness \"to the living and to the dead\" by letting the widow of his relative glean in his fields. To make a tie-in to Easter, there is a hint or glimpse of resurrection in the way this practice of redemption works to continue the family lines of those who died childless. This is quite evident in the conclusion to the book of Ruth:\nSo Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her. And the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the Lord who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name become famous in Israel. (Ruth 4:13–14)\nIn contrast to Onan and Judah, Boaz acts with exemplary character. He is generous to the poor, as evidenced by his fields being a favourable place to glean. And when Ruth comes to him at the threshing floor, he acts honourably toward her. Boaz could have easily had his way with Ruth, a foreign woman alone on his property at night. He probably could have even had her killed on contrived charges of trying to seduce him by acting as a fertility cult prostitute (like Tamar pretended to be). Then the associated property would have been available without the pesky complication of having more heirs in the picture. Instead he went public the very next day with his intentions to take on the role of redeemer. Of course Ruth (with Naomi's advice) also deserves credit for taking as much initiative as Tamar but in a much more vulnerable way, trusting Boaz to do the right thing openly instead of trying to seduce him furtively.\nThe stories of Onan and Boaz have more of a connection than the practice of redeeming/re-marrying a widow:\nNow these are the generations of Perez: to Perez was born Hezron, and to Hezron was born Ram, and to Ram, Amminadab, and to Amminadab was born Nahshon, and to Nahshon, Salmon, and to Salmon was born Boaz, and to Boaz, Obed, and to Obed was born Jesse, and to Jesse, [King] David. (Ruth 4:18–22).\nPerez was the son of Tamar, as we saw above. Ruth and Boaz's son Obed was the grandfather of David, the first descendant of Judah to have a king's scepter like the prophecy said.\nIn light of the context of who Judah and Tamar were and the contrast with how Boaz acted, let's return to the account of Onan. What was so bad about what Onan did? He did not show kindness to the living and the dead, but tried to have it both ways: getting his deceased brother's property and the pleasure of having sex with Tamar while shirking the responsibility that comes with the role of redeemer. Furthermore, he's standing against prophecy in two ways:\nPastor Tim Keller says,\nThere are, in the end, only two ways to read the Bible: Is it basically about me, or basically about Jesus? In other words, is it basically about what I must do or basically about what He has done?\nThe discussion above connects to Jesus in a few ways:\nPermalink",

(I'm quite busy with my job right now, so this will probably be the last post until around Easter—but it provides plenty to read if you follow the links).\nSummer will be here before we know it, so it's not too soon to plan some adventures. I've been to most of the Canadian national parks on this list (aside from the ones in the territories), but I haven't been to Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan. I don't know if it will work out yet, but I'd like to go camping there this year. Grasslands also makes an appearance on this list of great campsites (the entries for Waterton, Fjord-du-Saguenay, and Cape Breton Highlands also look really appealing).\nAn article in The Economist about \"rewilding\" looks interesting (unfortunately only a couple of paragraphs are available without subscribing):\nScientifically, [rewilding] rests on the theory of trophic cascades. This holds that ecosystems are shaped by “apex consumers”—large herbivores and carnivores atop food chains. Remove them, as humans are wont to do, and the mixture of species lower down the food chain mutates, often to the detriment of biodiversity. When wolves were chased out of Yellowstone National Park, in the United States, for instance, unchecked deer outcompeted bison and beavers for food. The wolves’ return in 1995 rapidly unwound these changes. That success has spurred dozens of other projects.\nAn artsy documentary I watched recently showed some mine sites around the world and how they impact the landscape, so I was interested to read this article about mine rehabilitation in Australia. Topsoil is an important piece of the puzzle.\nA less cheerful environmental story is this one, showing which rivers discharge the most plastic waste into the oceans. On the bright side, the amount of plastic coming from rivers in North America is low, so if best practices for waste management can spread around the globe it would do a lot to stem the flow.\nAlso about the ocean, this article about the Ocean Observatories Initiative discusses using multi-sensor arrays and big data techniques to hopefully gain a better understanding of the big picture of interconnected oceanic ecosystems.\nThe BlueTech Forum is coming up in a couple of months. I don't expect to be going, but it looks like a nice event for the water industry. Their website has some interesting conversations with people who will be presenting, including an overview of the history and future of water infrastructure.\nWhat Sedlak discovered through his deep-dive into the history of urban water systems was that the history of solving problems in water infrastructure was not one of incremental change and development, but rather of rapid catch-up when the problems became too big to ignore.\nNASA has some timelapses of satellite photos showing changes in land use or the environment at significant sites around the world. This one shows the tentative recovery of marshland in Iraq. On a related topic, Ramsar keeps track of significant wetlands in countries around the world.\nCellulosic ethanol is a very attractive biofuel. As ethanol, it can be blended with gasoline and used (up to a certain blend) in the engines of existing vehicles without modification. Unlike conventional ethanol, cellulosic ethanol can be made from low-value parts of agricultural crops (like stems and leaves) instead of parts we eat (like corn kernels). However, it hasn't yet become commercially viable without subsidies. Here is a really good article about the history of attempts at producing cellulosic ethanol and how government mandates can't bring technology into existence simply because they want it:\nInterestingly, there was no commercial cellulosic ethanol production when the mandates were established, but proponents of the technology were certain that commercialization would come in response to the mandates.\nHere is a cute tutorial on evaluation matrices that draws on classical mythology and OKCupid.\nThis comic about college costs, admission processes, and credentials raises an interesting point, in my opinion. (I read a book by the author and his wife last year).\nHere is a brief biography of Confucius.\nHarissa is a tasty Moroccan spice with a bit of kick. I picked up a jar of it recently so this page of recipe ideas seems handy.\nIn Spanish, \"por qué, porque, por que and porqué\" all have different meanings. Here's a guide.\nApparently around 11% of new businesses in Canada fail within the first two years. But this post argues that a certain level of constant churning is essential to a strong economy and shouldn't be stifled (and entrepreneurs should be willing to fail and try again).\nHere's an article about how cryptocurrencies can be useful in places where people don't have good access to conventional banking. It also touches on the crisis in Venezuela.\nLast, but not least, here are some articles about a couple of mathematical topics: knots and pentagon tiling. (Tiling is a topic I've blogged about before).\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is just a few quick reviews of some movies I've watched recently.\nIncendies is a French-Canadian movie from 2010. It was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign-language film. It is directed by Denis Villeneuve (who's done a few other movies I like); it's been on my list to watch for a while and it recently became available on Netflix so I finally got around to watching it. I was not disappointed. This movie takes place in Lebanon (it never actually says so, but it's set in a Middle Eastern country going through a sectarian civil war in the 1970s and 1980s) and Montreal. The plot is kicked off with twins (\"les jumeaux\") Simon and Jeanne meeting with a notary for the reading of their mother's will. They have only known life in Canada but the will instructs them to return to her homeland, find a father and brother they have never met, and deliver letters to them. The film weaves together scenes from their mother's life with Jeanne and Simon's travels in Lebanon getting to know aspects of her past she had never discussed while she was alive. In the past, the mother gets swept up in the civil war; in the present, some dark family secrets come to light. Overall this is a really moving film. Villeneuve's ponderous style works well at building the tension. The backdrop of the Lebanese countryside further contributes to the austere beauty.\nTheeb (ذيب) is an Arabic movie from 2014. It was also nominated for an Oscar for best foreign-language film. It is set in the Hejaz region of Arabia in 1916. The Ottoman Empire has built a railroad through this area. This has brought disruptions to the local way of life. One character (who used to make a living guiding pilgrims through the desert but turned to banditry when the train made that occupation obsolete) says that, \"A month by camel now takes a week by train\". Because the First World War is going on in the wider world, there are also British officers in the area, trying to sabotage the railroad and encourage the local tribes to rise up against the Ottomans—basically what Lawrence of Arabia did, although he doesn't appear in the movie. Theeb is the name of the main character, and he's a boy too young (maybe around 8?) to care about the context I just explained. However, when a British officer shows up at his tribe's encampment, Theeb is fascinated with the man's belongings (such as a pocket watch, and especially a locked box that he won't let anyone touch). So when his older brother leaves to guide the Englishman through the desert to a certain well, Theeb sneaks along until they are too far from the encampment to send him back alone. The main part of the movie is about travelling through and surviving in the desert, seen through the eyes of a boy. Theeb faces dangers from bandits, wild animals, thirst, and the rugged terrain and is forced to grow up quickly.\nAndhadhun is an Indian movie from 2018. It is set in Pune. I haven't really watched any Bollywood films before, but I got a specific recommendation for this one and it was available on Netflix. I went ahead and watched it and quite enjoyed it. The main character is a talented pianist who everyone thinks is blind (he actually can see more than he lets on). Two events change his life: he meets a girl who becomes his muse when she accidently runs into him with a scooter; and he is at the scene of a murder where the perpetrators only let him go because they assume he saw nothing. The chain of events that follows has as many misapprehensions and twists as a good Shakespeare play. In addition to the plot, I found this film interesting as a glimpse into contemporary Indian culture. For example, one thing that stood out was how much English was interspersed in the language the characters were speaking (which I assume was Hindi).\nOf these three movies, Incendies is the one I would recommend the most (but you have to be in the mood for a heavy drama). Andhadhun was the one I'd say was the most entertaining.\nHere are trailers for these three movies:\nIn addition to the movies discussed above, I wanted to quickly mention a hike I went on earlier this week. I was in Pennsylvania on a business trip and had a free evening so I went on a short—but strenuous—hike. The hike was at the Lehigh Water Gap (on the east side of the river); it is the first one mentioned in this list. I went up the ridge on a section of the Appalachian Trail (white blazes), which was quite steep, and came back down a longer trail (blue blazes) with a gradient that was a bit less intense. Here's a view of the gap from near the top of the ridge:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I've written an analysis of the New Brunswick provincial budget for the past four years now. As always, my goal is to focus on the facts more than on political commentary. Following the regular look at the budget, this year's post features a deeper dive into the crown corporation of Énergie NB Power.\nI'll start with a few things to keep in mind while reading this post:\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead:\nAs this article covering the budget notes, this is the first time in 13 years that the provincial government is budgeting a surplus. However, there was actually a tiny surplus ($4.5M) in the fiscal year that just ended. There had been a deficit of $189M forecast, but revenues came in higher than expected (so did expenses, but the increase in revenue was greater). As far as I can see, the big difference between what was budgeted and what was received came from income and property taxes; I'm not aware that any rates went up so this is probably due to an increase in the size of the tax base (i.e. amount of income reported in the province and assessed values of homes).\nThe following graph shows the expenses and revenues forecast (to be consistent, I'm using the projected values from the start of each fiscal year not the actual values from their ends) in each budget since I've started blogging about them. The deficit (or surplus, depending on the direction) is the gap between the expenses and revenue illustrated by the vertical line. I've also added a horizontal line to illustrate a different way of looking at the deficit: as a time lag before revenues catch up to expenses. For the past five years I've been following it, this gap has only been around a year, meaning the deficit could have been eliminated sooner simply by slowing the growth of spending.\nThe departments with the largest budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are as follows (these figures and the following graph are for their ordinary accounts which don't include capital spending, amortization, etc.):\nThere has been no change in the rankings of these major departments since the last budget. Public Safety has been reorganized, though, and is now separate from the Justice Department.\nThe next graph shows the budgeted expenditures by department (if you're comparing this to a similar-looking graph in my post from last year, note that that one was of year-over-year change in spending) with the change from how much was spent (actually spent, not budgeted) from last year noted.\nThe largest change was in public safety. Last year they had a budget of $12M for security and emergencies but spent $87M (I assume for things like the flooding and the fatal shooting of 2 police officers in Fredericton). The departmental budget for 2019 is in between what was budgeted last year and what was actually spent.\nIn terms of departments and agencies aimed at developing the provincial economy, there were cuts to Opportunities NB and Tourism, but an increase to the Regional Development Corporation.\nThe budget for the department of Social Development increased, but only by 0.5% (less than inflation). Within this department, funding for seniors and long term care increased from $526M to $547M but funding for income security and housing services both decreased (by $6M and $9M, respectively).\nMoving to the revenue side of the 2019 budget, the major anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick include:\nThe next graph shows the budgeted revenue by source with the change from last year (actual, not budget) noted:\nI'm not aware of tax rates that are going to be changing, so I don't know why revenue from corporate taxes is projected to decrease while revenue from the HST is projected to increase. My assumption would be that these projections are based on economic forecasts for the province (e.g. decreased net revenue for New Brunswick corporations, increased consumer spending) but I don't know for sure. The change in the gas tax revenue is explained in the next section. The change in Investment revenue appears to be based on hoping that NB Power recovers from a bad year (only $14.7M in actual revenue last year, and $37.7M projected for the year ahead).\nIn light of my last post, it's perhaps interesting to point out that the provincial government received $0.43M in royalties on sand and gravel (almost as much as for natural gas).\nHere are a few quick notes on points I've discussed about the provincial budget in the past:\nCrown corporations have a board appointed by the government but operate at arm's-length. Based on this list the Crown corporations in the province include:\nAdd to the above the Health networks (Horizon and Vitalité) and Ambulance New Brunswick and a share in the Atlantic Lottery Corporation. As far as I understand, only a few of these (NB Power and NB Liquor, at least) are intended to provide a return on investment to the general provincial budget while the others are supposed to operate as not-for-profit corporations.\nThis page from the budget document reports revenue from these corporations/agencies:\nFor the remainder of this post, I want to focus on the Crown corporation of NB Power. It has a portfolio of electrical generation, transmission, and distribution assets that includes:\nThis figure shows a map of electrical generation capacity in the Martime provinces, with an inset pie chart of the composition of the power sources in New Brunswick (both images are from the National Energy Board; I just combined them for the purpose of this discussion):\nThe next figure comes from NB Power's 10 year plan and shows how generating capacity is expected to change over time. This is based on making some repairs to the Mactaquac dam to extend its life (with 1 out of 6 turbines out of service annually for 6 years starting in 2027 while repairs are made). It's also assuming that coal plants (Belledune has a capacity of 467 MW) can continue to be operated until 2040. However, there may be a requirement to phase out coal by 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so I coloured part of the bars red to indicate what would be subtracted if this capacity was lost a decade earlier than planned. I also coloured part of the bars orange to indicate what would be subtracted if Mactaquac dam was closed in 2030, which was one of the options considered for it. As the figure shows, NB Power is assuming the \"Energy Smart NB\" program can reduce/stabilize the demand for electricity. However, if coal is phased out early (and/or if the decision had been made to close Mactaquac dam in 2030) then there would be a gap in capacity to make up almost a decade earlier than planned.\nIn the 2017–2018 fiscal year (the most recent annual report is not available yet), NB Power had 17 billion kWh available for distribution (6.6 billion kWh were purchased). Of this, around 13 billion kWh was sold in the province and 3.5 billion kWh was sold via interconnections to other jurisdictions. They received $1754M in revenue. Expenses included $727M for the purchase of fuel and electricity, 477M for operations (including maintenance and administration), and $264M for finance costs (mainly interest on debt), among other things. Their net earnings were $23M. The total net debt at that time was $4767M; their capital structure comprised 93% debt—one of their objectives for the future is to lower that ratio. According to the New Brunswick AG, \"NB Power is supposed to be an independent company, and its assets, liabilities and debt are not on the province's books.\"\nIf you are a customer of NB Power, this table from the 10 year plan will be of interest. It looks like rates will increase by 3.7% annually after this year (see the highlighted box)—2% from general inflation plus 1.7% for the roll-out of the carbon tax (which increases in $10/tonne CO2e increments until 2022 and the NB Power rate increases lag by a year).\nFinally, it's not owned by NB Power, but I wanted to share this photo of solar panels on the roof of Fredericton High School (apparently the province spent around $0.5M on them). When driving past them after some storms this winter, I sometimes noticed they were covered in snow (they didn't spend all winter like this, to be clear). The other part of the following image is a chart from NB Power's Integrated Resource Plan showing how the demand for electricity varies throughout the year. A source like this that is not available when it's needed most is not ideal (this is not a knock on solar power in general, just pointing out that forms of renewable energy should be used where they make the most sense; this map, for example, shows strong trends in what types of renewable energy are installed in which region of the US (e.g. solar in the southwest, wind in a corridor from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes)). Wind power—NB Power currently has power purchase agreements in place for almost 300 MW of installed capacity—and nuclear are more promising sources of clean energy here, in my opinion.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post contains reviews of a couple of books I've read recently. They relate to a similar theme as the previous post—how people are reshaping the earth.\nDirt: The Erosion of Civilizations by Dr. David R. Montgomery is about the history of soil as a requirement for agriculture, and the consequence when it erodes away or its quality deteriorates. The World in a Grain by Vince Beiser is about sand as a commodity—used in everything from concrete to CPUs—and how it is in increasing demand. Both of these books had some interesting things to say. I found The World in a Grain was more readable and engaging, though; Dirt had a tendency to say the same thing over and over in places—for example, a lot of the stats about erosion rates (inches per year or tons per acre per year) would have been better off being summarized and maybe included in a table somewhere for reference.\nDirt starts off with explaining the importance of soil. It then moves on to discussing how soil is in a dynamic balance between its formation (from rocks breaking down and being mixed with organic matter) and rate of erosion, and different types of soils. The main part of the book moves through the history of agriculture, from the initial transition from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to the use of chemical fertilizers and powerful tractors. The places and periods of history it looks at include the ancient near east, classical antiquity in the Mediterranean, medieval Europe, westward expansion in the USA, and isolated Pacific islands. A central idea of Montgomery's books is expressed here:\nIn the broadest sense, the life span of a civilization is limited by the time needed for agricultural production to occupy the available arable land and then erode through the topsoil. How long it takes to regenerate the soil in a particular climate and geologic setting defines the time required to reestablish an agricultural civilization-providing of course that the soil is allowed to rebuild.\nThe World in a Grain is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on uses of sand in the first half of the twentieth century for things like concrete buildings, asphalt roads, and glass. The second section focuses on more recent ways sand is used: silicon computer chips, fracking, beach replenishment, and artificial islands. It also discusses the threat posed by desertification in certain places. The penultimate chapter returns to concrete, which is being used in truly astounding quantities in the twenty-first century as urbanization spreads to almost every country. A recurring metaphor for sand in the book is that the grains are soldiers. In concrete (and asphalt and artificial islands) they have strength in numbers, while for more specialized purposes (e.g. silicon chips or frac sand) \"elite\" sands are required (but in smaller quantities). This excerpt from the transition between the two main sections summarizes some of the main points of Beiser's book:\nIn the twentieth century, concrete, asphalt, and glass utterly transformed the built environment for countless millions in the Western world. Armies of sand brought us skyscrapers and suburbs, windows and bottles for everyone, and the paved roads that the automobile depends on. In the twenty-first century, that sand-based way of life is spreading with blinding speed across the entire world. In this new era, the sand armies are taking on even more world-changing missions. Sand is now being used to build entire new lands, to pull oil from previously inaccessible pockets of the earth, and to create the digital devices that permeate our lives. A century and a half ago, sand was a useful accessory, a handy tool for a handful of purposes. Today our civilization depends on it.\nWith those introductions out of the way, I want to delve into some of the topics that appear in both books, then share some other interesting things I learned from them.\nAlthough sand and soil are not the same thing, there are some processes (e.g. erosion) that affect both of them. I thought this review would be more interesting if I discussed some of the topics that appear in both books together here.\nErosion came up as a concern in both books, especially Dirt. Plowing breaks up soil to make planting easier, but it also leaves it susceptible to being carried away by run-off or wind. The amount lost might seem small, but it adds up over time and over vast areas:\nEvery second, North America's largest river carries another dump truck's load of topsoil to the Caribbean. Each year, America's farms shed enough soil to fill a pickup truck for every family in the country. This is a phenomenal amount of dirt. But the United States is not the biggest waster of this critical resource.\nFortunately, there are ways to reduce soil erosion that have been understood for a long time (although often not applied due to pressure to maximize yields in the short term or a lack of resources to implement them):\nMany soil conservation measures are proven technologies. Measures adopted to curb soil erosion after the Dust Bowl were not new ideas-contour plowing and cover cropping were known more than a century before. Crop rotations, mulching, and the use of cover crops are ancient ideas. So is terracing, which can reduce erosion by 90 percent, enough to offset the typical increase in erosion rates from cultivation.\nApparently there are also methods of \"conservation tillage\" (and even no-till farming) that are becoming more popular as ways to maintain good soil.\nWhen it comes to sand, Beiser notes that in some places it is collected from riverbeds and beaches. This practice increases erosion. River deltas can shrink when less sediment is reaching them, and the removal of beaches—he notes an incident in Jamaica where an entire quarter-mile-long beach was stolen (from one resort and probably transferred to another)—leaves coasts more vulnerable to erosion.\nWhile I had these books in progress, I was on a business trip to Iowa. On my trip home, while flying between Minneapolis and Chicago, the landscape below (somewhere in western Wisconsin I'd guess) included some of the features I'd been reading about. There are a few spots with what looks like contour plowing or mild terracing and other spots where it looks like gullies are being eroded into the fields.\nIn The World in a Grain, there is a chapter about mining for frac sand. An excerpt from it relates to soil conservation; topsoil is saved for future mine reclamation:\nThe topsoil is piled somewhere out of the way; it will be needed to help reclaim the land once the mine is tapped out, as required by law. Mississippi Sand has built a huge berm out of the topsoil, which helps block the neighbors’ view of the mine. Once the sand is all gone, the plan is to restore the hills; they’ll just be about a third smaller than before.\nAlthough it doesn't seem as intensive as some forms of mining, Beiser emphasizes that collecting sand is an extractive industry and is not without impacts. However, protesting against every proposed quarry in your area isn't a good solution either. There has to be a balance. Sand is essential for many things we rely on, and the distance it has to be hauled is a big portion of the cost. And it will come from somewhere:\nIf you forbid sand mining in your backyard—as many American communities do—then the sand to build your highways and shopping malls will have to be brought in from somewhere else. ... In some situations, well-intentioned efforts to protect the local environment end up simply exporting the damage to somewhere with looser laws and less privileged citizens.\nBoth books express concern about the most accessible and highest quality deposits of soil and sand, respectively, being used up. Montgomery sees a recurring pattern in history:\nIn a broad sense, the history of many civilizations follows a common story line. Initially, agriculture in fertile valley bottoms allowed populations to grow to the point where they came to rely on farming sloping land. Geologically rapid erosion of hillslope soils followed when vegetation clearing and sustained tilling exposed bare soil to rainfall and runoff. During subsequent centuries, nutrient depletion or soil loss from increasingly intensive farming stressed local populations as crop yields declined and new land was unavailable. Eventually, soil degradation translated into inadequate agricultural capacity to support a burgeoning population, predisposing whole civilizations to failure. That a similar script appears to apply to small, isolated island societies and extensive, transregional empires suggests a phenomenon of fundamental importance.\nThis reminded me of something Designed for Dry Feet said about the reclamation of peat bogs in the Netherlands:\nDrainage of the peat allowed the inhabitants to create usable agricultural land, but the drawback was subsequent land subsidence. The three major causes of this subsidence were soil shrinkage, consolidation, and oxidation. ...\nBy the seventeenth century the peat domes had dropped to below NAP. As the reclaimed land subsided, high groundwater levels made the land unusable. Thus, the reclamation process was pushed further up the peat bog as is shown in Figure 1-8. In many cases the new reclaimed parcels simply followed the existing drainage patterns and became extensions of the old parcels. This process was repeated several times and often required the relocation of the entire farm. (p. 10 – 11)\nIn Indiana, a number of sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan were consumed for making glass at factories in Toledo, Ohio. The area was protected by the state government in the 70s and 80s and is now a national park.\nAnother topic that came up in both books was desertification. Montgomery writes that,\nLowdermilk* blamed overgrazing for unleashing erosion that destroyed the capacity of the land to support people.\n*an American who worked on soil conservation around the world; I'll discuss him a bit more below.\nBeiser is more poetic:\nThe vast legions of sand in the world’s deserts are largely useless when it comes to building cities; in some places, as if angry at being left out, they have become threats to those cities.\nAs he alludes to here, and explains in more detail elsewhere in The World in a Grain, desert sand is not really suitable for construction since its grains are too smooth and therefore don't interlock as well as needed for strong concrete. This leads to the irony of famously-sandy Saudi Arabia importing sand. But it makes me wonder if a way could be found to process/pre-treat desert sand to make it useable. A cost-competitive technique for doing so sounds like it would solve a lot of problems.\nIn China, a project attempting to stem the spread of the Gobi desert by planting trees is known as the great green wall. But whether the use of a lot of irrigation water to keep the trees alive will cause other problems is still in question. Beiser draws attention to the fact that the same agency is responsible for the project and for evaluating its success:\nConsidering that the SFA is tasked with both planting millions of trees and assessing whether it’s a good idea to plant millions of trees, you can understand why outsiders are skeptical of their findings.\nThe fight against desertification there has also involved relocating pastoral communities:\nThey are some of the hundreds of thousands of mostly Mongol, Kazakh, and Tibetan farmers and herders whom the Chinese government has forced to move off the grasslands and into urban areas, leaving their traditional way of life behind. Officially this is to reduce overgrazing. Many believe it’s also a land grab to free up water and other resources for Han Chinese businesses. In some places the herders have resisted with violent protests.\nUsing concerns about overgrazing to make traditional herders settle in one place was the subject of a chapter in Water on Sand, a book I reviewed last year.\nThere were other things I learned from these books (and a few related links I wanted to share) that didn't really fit into the discussion above.\nMontgomery seems to worried that the growing global population will exceed the amount of food that can be produced from the amount of land with good soil. He says,\nearly in the twentieth century it was clear that further population growth would have to come from increasing crop yields rather than plowing more land.\nBut he also reports that,\nWorldwide, over two billion acres of virgin land have been plowed and brought into agricultural use since 1860. Until the last decades of the twentieth century, clearing new land compensated for loss of agricultural land. In the 1980s the total amount of land under cultivation began declining for the first time since farming reached the land between the Tigris and Euphrates. (emphasis added)\nThis notion of peak farmland was also mentioned in a book I reviewed a few years ago. The author of that book, Ron Bailey, has a more optimistic perspective on it, taking it as a sign that agricultural yields are increasing faster than population. I'm inclined to agree with him. New techniques like vertical farming hold the potential to continue to increase food production without using up more land to do so. Also, Hans Rosling makes a convincing case that population growth is starting to level off (the number of children being born has peaked and further growth will mainly come from the fill-up effect).\nThis discussion quantifying the potential benefits of soil conservation is a good fit with another book I've read:\nDepending on the particular crop and circumstances, a dollar invested in soil conservation can produce as much as three dollars' worth of increased crop yields. In addition, every dollar invested in soil and water conservation can save five to ten times that amount in costs associated with dredging rivers, building levees, and flood control in downstream areas.\nBecause of my career, I know a bit about the practice of applying wastewater sludge (after digestion/stabilization) to agricultural lands. Dirt has a couple of things to say that support the benefits of adding organic matter and nutrients in this way:\nSoil organic matter is essential for sustaining soil fertility not so much as a direct source of nutrients but by supporting soil ecosystems that help promote the release and uptake of nutrients. Organic matter helps retain moisture, improves soil structure, helps liberate nutrients from clays, and is itself a source of plant nutrients.\nEventually it may well be worth reconfiguring the downstream end of modern sewage systems to close the loop on nutrient cycling by returning the waste from livestock and people back to the soil.\nHere are some more points from or related to Dirt:\nLowdermilk realized that the heavy load of silt eroded from the highlands began to settle out when the river's slope dropped to less than one foot per mile. The more silt built up the riverbed, the faster farmers raised the dikes. There was no winning this game.\nLoess is a type of soil that is very fertile but also easily eroded.\nHere is a neat infographic on land use in the USA.\nThere are also some more things I wanted to share from or prompted by Beiser's book:\nOn its own, concrete is basically artificial stone. Reinforced with iron or steel, though, it becomes a building material unlike anything found in nature, one that combines the strengths of both metal and stone. That’s what makes it so useful for so many purposes.\nConcrete has saved countless lives and enriched even more. Concrete dams generate electricity. Concrete hospitals and schools can be built and repaired far more quickly than their counterparts of adobe, wood, or steel. Concrete roads help farmers get their crops to market, students to get to school, sick people to get to hospitals, and medicines to get to villages in all weathers.\nAt least seventy people were murdered in violence related to illegal sand mining over the same period. The victims include an eighty-one-year-old teacher and a twenty-two-year-old activist who were separately hacked to death, a journalist burned to death, at least three police officers run over by sand trucks and another who had his throat slit and fingers chopped off, all in India. In Kenya, a police officer was slashed to death with machetes, two truck drivers were burned alive, and at least half a dozen other people were killed in fighting over sand.\nHere is an account of sand being mined in Cambodia to be shipped to Singapore.\nThomas Edison wanted to build homes out of concrete. At the time, the idea didn't go anywhere, but now they can even be 3d-printed from concrete.\nRalph A. Bagnold was a fascinating individual—a WW2 hero and a sand researcher.\nAs a young officer, Eisenhower participated in a cross-continent vehicle convoy at a time when there were only local roads. The experience clearly stuck with him because when he became president he launched a big strategic project to develop a highway network:\nAlong with pretty much every other officer on the journey, Eisenhower recommended to his superiors that somebody do something to improve America’s roads. Many years later, he himself got to be that someone. In fact, he would launch the construction of what was for decades the most advanced and encompassing network of paved roads ever built: the US interstate highway system.\nAccording to the International Association of Dredging Companies, if good quality sand is available within a reasonable distance, new seafront land can be built for less than $536 per square meter—a fraction of the cost of buying existing seafront land in hot spots like Hong Kong, Singapore, or Dubai.\nAll told, according to a Dutch research group, human beings since 1985 have added 5,237 square miles of artificial land to the world’s coasts—an area about as big as Connecticut or the nation of Jamaica\nSome of the most dramatic applications (although the Spratly Islands could prove more impactful) have been in Dubai. The world islands are one example, although many of them are still bare patches of sand due to a turndown in the real estate market since the project was started.\nBeach replenishment is carried out (sometimes at great expense) partly for the tourism value of beaches, but it also has other benefits:\nIncreasingly, though, beaches are also coming to be valued for something else that might prove even more important than tourist revenue. These seaside armies of sand are a powerful protective force for the people living near them. Beaches are bulwarks that can protect lives and property from storms and rising seas in our climactically imperiled world. Coastal protection has become one of the main justifications for beach renourishment, and with good reason.\nTaking this principle further, the Netherlands is deliberate about leaving coastal dunes as a layer of protection from storm surges as I learned from Designed for Dry Feet (referred to above):\nThe Dutch Dunes are a critical weapon in the defense of the country against the sea. Since much of the land behind the dunes lies below sea level (see Figure 13), any break in the dunes would have catastrophic results. A number of measures have been taken to ensure the stability and continuity of the dunes. As early as the sixteenth century, the government organized efforts to preserve the dunes by planting dune grass or marram. In some locations, backup dikes were constructed behind the dunes. ...\nCurrents and waves are continually moving sand along the coast. In some areas, there is a net loss, resulting in a recession of the dunes. In other areas, there is a net gain. Today, the primary tool used to combat the recession of the dunes is sand replenishment. In this process, sand is dredged from the North Sea as far as 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) from the coast. ... Sand replenishment locations are determined based on a yearly mapping of the coastline. The objective is to maintain the Dutch coastline at the 1990 reference position (Meijer 1996).\nIt should be noted that, even at locations that are most at risk, hard measures, such as dams and dikes, are no longer being considered to maintain the coastline. Only soft measures, such as sand replenishment, are applied today. In the long run, hard measures are usually unsatisfactory. (p. 97 – 98)\nI'll close this post with some big-picture thoughts about soil and sand from Montgomery and Beiser:\nin the big picture, soil regulates the transfer of elements from inside the earth to the surrounding atmosphere. Life needs erosion to keep refreshing the soil-just not so fast as to sweep it away altogether.\nSoil truly is the skin of the earth-the frontier between geology and biology.\nWe humans bind together countless trillions of grains of sand to build towering structures, and we break apart the molecules of individual grains to make tiny computer chips.\nPermalink",

    "content": "When I went to the AGO back in the fall I mentioned that there was an upcoming exhibit I wanted to see called \"Anthropocene\". I didn't make it back to the gallery while it was on, so I watched the accompanying film on iTunes.\nAnthropocene was made by Jennifer Baichwal, Nicholas de Pencier and Edward Burtynsky. It is narrated—lightly, since the visuals are supposed to speak for themselves—by Alicia Vikander (I thought she was great in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Tomb Raider; Tulip Fever had awkward pacing among other weaknesses, but the acting in it was fine). The title comes from a proposed geological epoch in which \"humans have changed the earth and its processes more than all natural forces combined.\"\nAs you would expect from a project that was shown in art galleries, the cinematography for this movie was very well done. I also appreciated that although it deals with serious environmental topics it avoids being preachy and lets viewers draw their own conclusions. It is divided into seven sections: Extraction, Terraforming, Technofossils, Anthroturbation, Boundary Limits, Climate Change, and Extinction. It visits places as diverse as a foundry in Russia, a rail tunnel in Switzerland, an ivory shop in Hong Kong, and a coral reef during a bleaching event. Rather than try to recap the entire movie, I'm just going to focus on a few scenes and points that stood out to me. First, here are a couple of screenshots (apologies for the low quality—iTunes doesn't let you use the screenshot function while a movie is playing) that I found had striking visuals:\nReading my descriptions is one thing and seeing the visuals for yourself is another. Anthropocene is certainly worth seeing.\nFor my next post, I'm planning to review a couple of books that have some overlap with the themes of this movie.\nPermalink",

I've gone to some events in it the past several years, but I don't think I've written about it before.\nOne of the events that I was looking forward to (and even got a ticket for) but ended up missing due to being delayed getting back from a business trip was an adult night at a science museum downtown.\nThere is a nice open ice surface in Officers' Square. It is used for some Frostival events, but it's also free for skating whenever. I really enjoy stopping there on my way home for a bit of skating on evenings when the weather's decent.\nA fun event that I've gone to in a couple of previous years is a snowshoeing hike after dark. It fills up fast, however, so you have to sign up well in advance to participate.\nThe main event I made it to this year was a \"gallery hop\": open houses for art galleries downtown. At Gallery 78 I admired some work by artists including Peter Salmon and James Wilson. At the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, one of the new exhibits since the last time I was there was a collection of wood-turnings (bowls, urns, etc.) by the late Gordon Dunphy. As the following picture shows, he was able to produce some remarkable patterns by the way the turning axis intersected with the grain. And he must have known wood very well based on the variety of species he used—each with a unique look.\n(The Gallery on Queen also had some of Dunphy's work on display).\nPermalink",

    "content": "Despite the same word appearing in both titles, this post is quite different from the previous one. The inspiration for making the project described in this post came partly from re-reading Anathem last year.\nA couple of books on complexity I read last year had some discussion on elementary (1-dimensional) cellular automata (in a different post I looked at 2-dimensional cellular automata). These are mathematical objects that consist of a row of cells that can be either on or off (values of 1 or 0). The state of each cell is changed by following a simple rule based on the states of its neighbours. The updated values are placed on the next row and the process repeats. Elementary cellular automata are interesting to study because the rules are very simple (so simple they can be represented by a single number between zero and 255) but they can exhibit very complex behaviour. See here for an introduction and a gallery of examples. One of the most famous rules, and the one I've worked with here, is Rule 110. Explaining what the number means is a good way to explain elementary cellular automata:\nA hydraulic computer uses water instead of electricity to perform computations. The one I decided to try to build would take three inputs and output the updated value of the centre cell according to Rule 110. In order to select the correct output from various inputs, some kind of logic gate is required. I found a paper by Taberlet, Marsal, Ferrand, and Plihon (2018) that a type of logic gate that uses water. Here is the abstract:\nIn this article, we propose an easy-to-build hydraulic machine which serves as a digital binary computer. We first explain how an elementary adder can be built from test tubes and pipes (a cup filled with water representing a 1, and empty cup a 0). Using a siphon and a slow drain, the proposed setup combines AND and XOR logical gates in a single device which can add two binary digits. We then show how these elementary units can be combined to construct a full 4-bit adder. The sequencing of the computation is discussed and a water clock can be incorporated so that the machine can run without any exterior intervention. (emphasis added)\nThe full paper is behind a paywall, but the abstract was enough to give me an idea, since I've seen a siphon tower used to turn continuous flow into intermittent flow (with no moving parts) at a hundred-year-old wastewater treatment plant.\nThe design I eventually settled on is as follows:\nHere are some photos of these components:\nThe way it is intended to work is that one cup from each upper pair is filled, to specify the input sequence. The water from these cups is distributed into 8 test cups. Only the test cup that perfectly matches the input sequence will have enough water to start its siphon flowing (basically the siphon has an \"activation energy\" threshold). Other test cups might receive flow from 1 or two of the input cups, but it will just discharge through the slow drain. Whether the siphon that does discharge is flagged with green tape or not indicates whether the output (i.e. the next state for the central cup) is 1 or 0.\nHere is a picture of the complete apparatus, with flow being distributed to the test cups (there are only two streams visible because the water has almost run out of the upper input cups) and one siphon flowing:\nI've been able to get each component working enough for a proof of concept, but so far the overall apparatus isn't really reliable. The flow doesn't get distributed evenly through the 4 tubes from each input cup. I think it needs more precision in having each tube terminate at the same level and perhaps larger diameter tubing to avoid air-locking. Neither the input cups nor the test cups will fully drain, giving them some dead volume so they aren't fully consistent (between cups or between runs). Again, more precision (or higher-quality materials) is needed. If the bugs could get ironed out, the next step would be to have a number of these assemblies in parallel. Each input cup would then need to have its volume distributed 12 ways (because it will act as the centre cell in one stack but the left-hand and right-hand cell in the neighbouring stacks and it needs a 4-way distribution for each stack)—so the precision requirements would be even higher. It would also be good for each stack to have a pair of output cups (rather than just flagging each siphon for their output value, they would be collected into the appropriate output cup); the pair of output cups could then be the input cups for a new row or could trigger pumping (from the drain tray/reservoir) back to the input cups in the top row.\nThe hydraulic computer presented in this post is a digital computer. Each input and output is either 1 or 0; either the level is reached for a siphon to start flowing or it isn't. However, probably the most famous example of a hydraulic computer was Bill Phillips' MONIAC, an analogue computer* for modelling the flow of money in a national economy:\n*Analog computers work with continuous instead of discrete values. This article (which I've only skimmed due to its length) goes into their history.\nAnother video that may be of interest if you've read this far is this one of another Rule 110 computer that someone built with marbles (and much more precision than my efforts above with water):\nHere are a few more links that may be of interest to wrap things up:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post combines two of my interests: engineering and paddling. During my undergrad studies (at the University of New Brunswick) I took a course called \"Open Channel Hydraulics\". Recently I decided to re-read some of my notes and textbooks and think about how they could provide insight for kayaking and canoeing on rivers. In addition to the practical applications, I hope it can illuminate some phenomena you might see while out on the water since I always find it's more satisfying when you understand what you're looking at.\nTo start with, what is an open channel? The \"open\" aspect refers to the fact that there is a free liquid surface exposed to the air, in contrast to flow in pipes (if they're full anyway). The \"channel\" aspect indicates that the water is semi-contained so that it only can flow in one direction; important geometric features of a channel are its slope in the direction of the flow and its cross-section (with a certain area and perimeter) perpendicular to the flow. For engineering purposes, there's a lot of attention paid to artificial channels (e.g. canals with a trapezoidal cross-section), but the equations and analytical tools are also relevant to natural channels (i.e. rivers). Because oceans (and large lakes) are not in a channel, this post isn't very relevant to sea kayaking.\nThe thematic thalweg of this post is the concept of energy—where it comes from and where it goes (since ultimately energy is conserved) in rivers. The following equation summarizes the three relevant components of energy in open channel hydraulics:\nIn this equation, z is the elevation (above sea level or another convenient datum), p is the water pressure, ρ is the density of water, g is gravity, and v is the velocity of the river. Each term has units of distance (metres in the metric system) so they can be compared on the same basis; their sum is known in engineering as the head—energy represented as the height to which water would rise in a standpipe. Because the pressure is zero at the surface and a maximum at the river bed, the second term (p / ρ g) equates to the water depth. The third term (v2/2 g) is the additional height from the surface that water would rise in a pitot tube (i.e. if its velocity was stagnated). The sum of the latter two terms (i.e. depth plus velocity head, ignoring elevation above sea level) is known as the specific energy.\nAs a river moves downhill/downstream, energy is moved between these three components and some is dissipated to the surroundings due to friction (this portion is known as headloss). The elevation, z, decreases along the water course; gravity feeds into the river's specific energy.\nFrom the above equation, there are three sloping surfaces to consider:\nAs a paddler, you can only consistently see surface 2 (although if the water is clear or shallow enough, you can see surface 1), but it is a good exercise to try to visualize the other surfaces. In slow-moving waters, surface 3 is almost touching surface 2, while the gap between them increases in fast currents. Surface 3 will always be sloped downstream as energy is lost (converted by friction to heat and noise) and its slope increases as the current does (because faster flows find more resistance from friction). So this means that surface 3 does not rise when the flow speeds up but rather surface 2 dips. Look at the flow around a rock and you can see this in action: in front of the rock the water mounds up a bit (surface 2 touching surface 3 at the point of stagnation) while at the sides the water surface dips (surface 2 separating from surface 3 as the velocity increases). When you add in the undulations of the river bed, you get slow-moving deep flow in pools (surface 2 is far from surface 1 and close to surface 3) and fast shallow flow in riffles (surface 2 is close to surface 1 and not as close to surface 3). Water can't flow up hill, but if surface 2 is far from surface 3 the gap between them can close quickly in a jump (discussed below), so having an intuition for these three sloped surfaces can help with your situational awareness on a river.\nI'm trying not to get too heavily into hydraulic equations in this post, but one that is essential in open channel hydraulics is the Manning formula. The Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering Systems textbook by Hwang & Houghtalen explains that,\nTo solve open channel flow problems, we must seek the interdependent relationships between the slope of the channel bottom, the discharge, the water depth, and other given channel conditions.\nThe Manning formula ties these factors together:\nAs above, v is the velocity. The factor n relates to the channel roughness. It can't be measured in a practical way, but there are tables of suggested values depending on the conditions in the channel; most natural rivers would have n between 0.025 – 0.075. R is the \"hydraulic radius\", which is defined as the area of the flow's cross-section divided by the wet portion of the perimeter (so not including the top surface). For the purposes of this post, the average depth of the river is a decent enough approximation for R. S is the energy gradient, that is, the slope of surface 3 defined above. In a stretch of river with uniform, steady flow (i.e. constant depth and flow in space and time) the three slopes will be parallel, so it's probably more convenient to use the slope of the river bed in calculations since it can be practically measured.\nWe're looking at the Manning formula for what it can tell us about rivers, not to get out our calculators before going paddling, so I'm going to draw out some implications of the above equation. If everything else is held constant, increased roughness will decrease the flow velocity, increased depth (technically \"hydraulic radius\") will increase it (since more of the flow is away from the river bed where it is subject to friction), and increase slope will increase it. However, in reality it is usually flow that is fixed so the picture becomes more complicated. Flow is equal to the average velocity times the area of the cross-section. So if roughness decreases the flow velocity, a larger cross-section (i.e. increased depth) is needed to pass the same flow. Increasing the average depth will increase both the area and average velocity so the flow increases faster than the velocity alone (although once a river spills out onto its floodplain, the area of the cross-section can increase much more than the average depth does).\nFor an example of the Manning formula in action, I looked at the Nashwaak River between Durham Bridge and Penniac Island. The river drops around 5 metres over a distance of about 14,000 m (only around 12 km as the crow flies) for a slope of 0.00036. The flow reaches around 50 cubic metres per second after rainstorms in the summer and the width of the stream is around 60 metres. Assuming a roughness of 0.035 then an average depth of 1.3 m (4.3 ft) and a flow of 0.65 m/s (2.1 ft/s) satisfies the Manning equation.\nReturning to the concept of specific energy introduced above, a fascinating implication is that, at a given flow, the same specific energy can occur at two different depths (with faster or slower velocities to arrive at the same flow). This is shown in the following graphs:\nThe chart on the left shows how a depth of 0.3 m can have the same specific energy as a depth of 0.75 m (at the flow I used in this example). The chart on the right has velocities; the higher branch of velocities goes with the lower branch of depths, and vice versa. In both graphs, it can be seen that the specific energy has a minimum value that is greater than zero—this is the minimum energy for conveying that flow. At this point, two-thirds of the specific energy is associated with the depth and one-third is associated with the velocity. The depth is known as the critical depth. When the water is deeper than the critical depth (the upper branch in the left graph and the lower branch in the right one) the flow is called \"sub-critical\" and when the water is below the critical depth it is called \"super-critical\" flow. If a barrier* is placed in a sub-critical stream that leaves less than the critical depth between the top of the barrier and the water surface than the water will pile up upstream until it can maintain the critical depth over the barrier. Downstream of a point where it passes through the critical depth, the flow will usually be super-critical.\n*the barrier can be a natural feature like a seam of harder rock that doesn't erode as much as the stream bed leading up to it.\nSuper-critical flow is something paddlers should pay attention to, because it is where you can find features like standing waves and hydraulic jumps. In sub-critical flow, if you toss a stone into the water, the ripples will spread upstream and downstream. In super-critical flow, however, the current is faster than the speed that ripples move at so they can't spread upstream. Ripples from stationary features can end up with successive crests lining up in the same location. This forms a standing wave. A hydraulic jump—where the water level slopes upward going downstream—is possible because there is a higher depth with the same specific energy (also recall the discussion above about surface 3). I won't share the equation for hydraulic jumps here due to its complexity, but basically the more super-critical the flow is leading into the hydraulic jump, the higher of a jump is possible (Wikipedia has a useful table). Hydraulic jumps dissipate a lot of energy (so the analysis is more complicated than drawing a straight vertical line to find the alternate depth on a specific energy graph) so they should be treated with caution.\nIn the preceding paragraph, I mentioned that flow could be more super-critical. This notion is quantified by something called the Froude number. In hydraulics, there are several dimensionless numbers (the numerator and denominator have the same units) that compare the magnitude of the two dominant forces in a flow situation. The Froude number compares momentum and gravity, which are usually the most relevant forces in open channel situations (another such dimensionless number is the \"Reynolds number\" that compares momentum and viscosity). The Froude number, Fr, is defined as follows:\nAs in the previous equations, v represents velocity and g represents gravity. L in this equation is a characteristic length dimension, which will be depth in this application. A couple of things to note are that both the numerator and denominator have units of m/s (in the metric system) making the ratio dimensionless overall, and that the term in the denominator is the speed of a gravity wave (such as a ripple). For Froude numbers less than 1, the flow is sub-critical and for Froude numbers greater than 1, the flow is super-critical. In addition to the test of whether ripples can spread upstream (indicating Fr < 1), a more qualitative assessment comes from a memorable sentence in my course notes from UNB:\nThe bigger the Froude number, the louder the river.\nThe Froude number also has an application in the analysis of boat hulls and the wakes they form. In that case, the characteristic length used is the length at the waterline, rather than the water depth. This document from Tasmania has interesting diagrams showing how a boat's wake changes as the Froude number increases. If I understand correctly (this is a topic I'd like to learn more about), at a Froude number of 0.4, a boat starts climbing up its bow wave and it begins planing at higher speeds. So Fr = 0.4 is considered the \"hull speed\". In a 3.05 m (10 ft) kayak this works out to a speed of 2.2 m/s, while in a 4.88 m (16 ft) kayak (or canoe) this works out to a speed of 2.8 m/s. To repeat a quote from this book that I shared in this post,\nMuch of the power expended in propelling a ship goes into wave-making and anything that can be done to reduce these waves results in increased efficiency\nSince a longer boat has the same kind of wake at a higher speed relative to a shorter one, it is able to move through the water more efficiently. This ties the discussion of hulls and wakes back into the energy-focused theme of this post. Waves carry energy, so wakes can be looked at as a type of wave that is carrying energy away from a boat.\nUnlike for sea kayaking, waves are usually less of a consideration for paddling on rivers (only short period waves have a chance to develop) so I won't spend much time on waves in this post. The one notable aspect I'll mention is the difference between wave velocity and group velocity. Group velocity is the speed at which a packet of waves advances. It is only half of the velocity of an individual wave. The reason for this has to do with the leading edge of the group needing time to set up the oscillation where the next wave should be before the group can actually advance. Waves don't really carry water forward (unless they are breaking); they have a rotational motion in place and it's only the pattern that moves across distances. This discrepancy between wave velocity and group velocity is why, for example, it takes longer for the wake of a passing boat to reach you than it appears the wake is moving.\nSo far, I've discussed how hydraulic jumps and friction with the river bed can dissipate energy (and I've also mentioned how the power used to propel a boat goes into setting up its wake). The energy is not actually lost, but it gets converted to forms such as heat and sound that can't do anything more for how the river flows. Another type of feature in open channel flow that can dissipate energy is eddies. Eddies are circular turbulent disturbances. They start at the scale of the feature that created them, but spawn smaller eddies in an energy cascade down to a dimension known as the Kolmogorov microscale. This process was described in a ditty by Lewis Fry Richardson:\nBig whorls have little whorls\nWhich feed on their velocity,\nAnd little whorls have lesser whorls\nAnd so on to viscosity.\nWhen the water is calm I like drawing my paddle through it and watching the eddies that mark its passage.\nOne of the final things I want to discuss in this post is sediment. Rivers carry more than just water—they can carry significant amounts of clay, rock, and everything in between, depending on the flow and other factors. It is part of their dynamic nature that they carve their own channel (and can build deltas a significant distance out into the sea under the right conditions). The relevance of sediment to us as paddlers is in the clues it can provide about the possible flow velocities that can be experienced in a section of river. In general, a sand bar was probably deposited at a lower flow velocity than a gravel bar was, for example. The following chart (from Wikipedia) is not really in standard use anymore, but it still gives a general idea of the relationship between the flow velocity and the size of sand/rock grains that will be eroded or deposited or carried along:\nThis post has gotten long enough, so I'm going to wrap it up here, but there are certainly other topics that could be added to this exploration of how open channel hydraulics can apply to paddling. These include things like backwater and drawdown curves (gradually varied non-uniform flow), velocity profiles (across the width and depth of a cross-section), and flow nets as a visualization tool. I hope to do some more writing on this subject in the future. There are also some software programs for modelling/visualizing open channel flow and it might be neat to try to learn how to use some of them.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Just a short link suggestion for this week's post.\nIt's no news that privacy concerns on social media (and the internet in general) are becoming more prominent. One crucial mechanism for keeping businesses honest is competition. So in this post, I want to suggest a possible alternative to Facebook.\nMinds.com is a social networking site that takes privacy and freedom of speech very seriously. Here is part of their (very readable) terms & conditions:\nMinds software and services are designed to give you as much control and ownership over your social experience as possible and to encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you publish. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear on your channel or get linked to/from your channel (things like spam, malware, viruses, or illegal content or serious threats of violence.)\nIf you find content that is objectionable, then Unsubscribe, Mute, Block, Report or just swipe on by. Minds is an open, free and public commons where users respect the right to use free speech. Of course, you may find a violation of these Terms of Service as you traverse Minds, in which case please Report the channel\nAnother notable aspect of Minds is its use of a token that is tied to the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens allow for things like subscription content and sending tips. A profile of the site in WIRED explains:\nThe tokens on Minds can be used for more than just ads; they essentially power the social network's entire ecosystem. Using Wire, the platform's built-in Patreon-like feature, users can tip creators, or pay for exclusive content, if someone chooses to place a post behind a paywall. You can also earn tokens by contributing to Minds' code, or discovering software bugs; the entire site is open source. Last month, Minds began testing converting its token system—which were previously called points—into a new cryptocurrency, the Minds token, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain network. In theory, Minds users will eventually be able to take their tokens to exchanges, and convert them into another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, or even into dollars.\nI signed up for a channel (their term for an account) on Minds a couple of weeks ago. So far it seems like it has some potential, although I'd need to have most of my friends using it before it would become my main social network. The dominant social networks (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, and maybe LinkedIn) can only really be replaced in a mass quorum → cascade process (see here for some general discussion on network effects). The open terms of service on Minds mean that there are channels there that might be blocked elsewhere, such as camgirls and alt-righters; however, explicit content is supposed to be tagged as such (and you have to opt-in to allow viewing it) and, as their policies say, you don't have to subscribe to anything you don't want to see. Finally, I'll note that I've tried to buy some of the Minds tokens using ETH but so far have not been able to—I get an error message each time. To be fair, the problem may be on my end, and I haven't seriously tried to resolve this issue since I've been able to earn a bit of the token through getting likes. I haven't tried using tokens for anything yet either.\nIf you'd like to try Minds, feel free to use my referrer link (disclosure: if you use it, I'll probably get some tokens from it).\nAnother social media site with a crytocurrency tie-in is Steemit, although I have not tried that one so I can't provide any comments about it.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I don't usually blog about politics (and don't plan to make a habit of it), but I have some genuine concerns I wanted to share about systematic weaknesses around building infrastructure in Canada. All of this is just my opinion, of course.\nIn the past year and a half, Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, has been in the news more than I can remember at any other time in my lifetime. There have been calls for schools named in his honour to be renamed, and statues of him have been vandalized. The reason for this negative attention is the way his government treated First Nations and the Métis. However, while Macdonald—like every leader in history—certainly has feet of clay, in this post I want to reflect on the positive part of his legacy.\nIn addition to being the first PM and a father of Confederation, Macdonald was a key proponent of building a railway across the country to the west coast; without a reliable transportation link, British Columbia may not have joined Canada. Here is how Wikipedia describes the achievement of building the Canadian Pacific Railway:\nWhile the railway was completed four years after the original 1881 deadline, it was completed more than five years ahead of the new date of 1891 that Macdonald gave in 1881. The successful construction of such a massive project, although troubled by delays and scandal, was considered an impressive feat of engineering and political will for a country with such a small population, limited capital, and difficult terrain. It was by far the longest railway ever constructed at the time.\nCould such a project be built now? My motivation for writing this post was this article, which opens with the provocative question,\nCan Canada build anything?\nThat’s the rather embarrassing question which lingers as these last days of 2018 trickle away. For the next decade at least, that question will be punctuated with an exclamation point in the form of the Peace Tower of Parliament, the Centre Block of which will lay vacant until literally God-knows-when. Certainly the government doesn’t know.\nThe article goes on to mention pipelines, LRT projects, military procurement, and renovations to the PM's residence as things that are hard to get built in the Canada of 2019. While the article is hyperbolic, I agree with the concern about the difficulty of executing infrastructure projects (whether by the public or private sector, or a partnership) at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. It's not hard to think of other examples, either. Two that come readily to mind are the Kitchener-Waterloo LRT (planned to open in 2017, and now delayed until at least the spring of this year) and the new Champlain Bridge in Montreal (planned to open last month and now delayed until at least this summer). Considering the CP Railway didn't meet its original deadline, construction delays are nothing new, but they are more understandable on an unprecedented undertaking far from existing infrastructure than when they've become seemingly routine even on projects of a local scope.\nI think it's important to get better at building infrastructure (and other stuff) in this country because I believe Canada is not done being built. I see a lot of upcoming risks and opportunities that will require effective development* of our infrastructure to address, such as:\n*A very bold proposal along these lines is the idea of a Mid-Canada/Northern Corridor, as pictured in the following map (the image comes from Wikipedia; I take no credit for it):\nBringing this post full circle, I don't really care if we keep statues and schools in honour of John A. Macdonald or not, but I hope we don't lose his vision of a united and connected Canada.\nPermalink",

    "content": "As at the end of years past, I'm writing this post to take a look back at what I've written over the past twelve months and highlight some of my favourite posts. It's also an opportunity to provide a convenient annual archive so readers can click on interesting links they may have missed.\nProbably the most notable thing that happened this year was buying a house. Getting settled in and starting to tackle various homeowner projects (like making a couple of pieces of DIY furniture) has taken a lot of my focus. But it's been enjoyable and I love the location.\nI took a memorable trip to Denmark and the Netherlands (mainly around Amsterdam and Rotterdam). For my job, I travelled to Virginia (and had some time to go on a couple of hikes there one weekend) amoung other places in the U.S. and Canada. Close to home, I went on a very good sea kayaking tour with Seascape on Deer Island.\nIn an effort to learn more programming skills I worked through a book called Seven Languages in Seven Weeks in the late winter/early spring. Here is the final post of my series on that, which contains a brief summary and links to the other posts. Now that some time has passed, I look back at Clojure as the most interesting language covered in that book and may try to find an opportunity to practice with it some more; Haskell might also be worth spending some more time with.\nMy first post of 2018 was partially about Bitcoin. Of course it and other cryptocurrencies have had a wild ride this year. My hope for 2019 is that—like in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble—speculation can cool off and some genuinely useful applications can come to the fore.\nIn 2018, I read over 20 books and reviewed a number of them on my blog. I don't often write about the novels I read—although I will briefly mention that Daniel Abraham's \"The Dagger and the Coin\" series was my favourite work of fiction this year—but most of the non-fiction ends up getting discussed. Factfulness by Hans Rosling is one that I widely recommend. The topics of Water on Sand (environmental history in the middle east) and Designed for Dry Feet (the engineering of dikes and related infrastructure in the Netherlands) are more niche*, but I certainly found them interesting to read and to write about. And the topic of complexity from my most recent book review post is something that I hope to touch on further in the future.\n*the latter review also contains a link to a case study I presented at a local conference, along with some Sankey diagrams as a graphical abstract.\nPartway through this past year I reached the milestone of 200 posts. If you're looking for some highlights from the archives you can find them there.\nFinally, two more posts from 2018 that I'd like to draw attention to are one about the arcane computer game Dwarf Fortress and one discussing a technical paper about biofilms.\nHere is the complete list of posts from this year (previous years: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017):\nHappy New Year!\nPermalink",

    "content": "This fall I read a couple of books about complexity: A Crude Look at the Whole by John H. Miller and Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell. For my final post of the year (except for an upcoming year in review post), I've reviewed these books and the concepts they cover.\nI've included two books in a book review post before (here, for example), but this time I decided to do something a bit different and read two books on the same subject for a single post. Given that the subject is complexity itself, the insight provided by more than one perspective also seemed like it would be beneficial. Miller and Mitchell are actually associated with the same institute (the Santa Fe Institute), but there was enough unique about each of their books that it certainly wasn't a waste of time to read both of them. I'll have more to say later on comparing the two books.\nTo start with, what is complexity? Miller contrasts it with reductionism; complex systems are ones that are more than a straightforward sum of their parts. To put it another way, complexity arises when interaction effects are a key feature of a system:\nThe reductionist approach to the world—breaking down complicated things to their constituent parts and then carefully dissecting these parts until we know them—has provided a useful Archimedean purchase from which to lever our complex world into the light of understanding. Unfortunately, there is only so far we can move the world using such tools. As we have seen throughout this book, knowing the parts is not equivalent to knowing the whole. Reduction does not tell us about construction. This is the fundamental insight of the study of complex systems. Even if we could fully understand how an individual worker bee’s, market trader’s, or neuron’s behavior is determined by its environment, we would have little idea about how a hive, market, or brain works. To truly understand hives, markets, and brains, we need to understand how the interactions of honeybees, traders, and neurons result in system-wide, aggregate behavior.\nMitchell points out that complexity is not a single scientific field but an interdisciplinary effort to find transferrable insights between diverse systems that exhibit complex behaviour:\nAs you can glean from the wide variety of topics I have covered in this book, what we might call modern complex systems science is, like its forebears, still not a unified whole but rather a collection of disparate parts with some overlapping concepts.\nAnd she concedes that a unified whole may not be possible. It is still an area of active research. But from the variety of examples given in both books, the analytical toolkit from studying complexity seems to have a lot of potential for advancing our understanding of the world.\nMiller lists some features/principles of complexity:\nthere are fundamental principles governing our world—such as emergence and organization—that appear in various guises across all of the nooks and crannies of science.\nInteracting systems develop feedback loops among the agents, and these loops drive the system’s behavior. Such feedback is moderated or exacerbated depending on the degree of heterogeneity among the agents. Interacting systems also tend to be inherently noisy, and such randomness can have surprising global consequences. Of course, who interacts with whom is a fundamental property of these systems, and such networks of interaction are an essential element of complex systems. Core principles such as feedback, heterogeneity, noise, and networks can be used to understand new layers of complexity.\nSome mathematical concepts that appear in both books are cellular automata and networks. These concepts have appeared before on my blog.\nHaving covered that background, I'm going to compare the two books then share and discuss some of the concepts and examples that they each cover.\nA Crude Look at the Whole was a quicker read than Complexity: A Guided Tour (I read most of the former on a couple of domestic flights). So if you're looking for an introduction to the subject, Miller's book is probably where I'd recommend starting. However, I wouldn't say Mitchell's book gets a lot more in-depth—the added length has more to do with going through the historical developments that led to the present field of complexity, along with drawing on more examples. Miller's book felt more unified (the excerpts above about eschewing reductionistic approaches and understanding interactions capture its theme) while Mitchell's book tries to cover the breadth of the field so the specific examples don't always fit together as neatly. The strength of Mitchell's book is the clear explanation of complicated topics like Turing machines and genetic algorithms—with worked-out examples in some cases. I'll mention more of these examples below. Complexity: A Guided Tour also includes a personal touch, with photos of people who contributed to the development of the field (the author seems to have personally met most of them who are still living).\nStarting with Miller's book (A Crude Look at the Whole) I want to share some things that I learned or found interesting:\nHe describes how bees maintain a comfortable temperature in their hives: individual bees can buzz to generate heat when they are cold or fan their wings to circulate air when they are hot. If every bee had exactly the same temperature setpoint the hive would oscillate rapidly between too hot and too cold as the bees alternated their behaviours. However, since each bee is slightly different, there is a smooth transition instead. As it cools off, for example, a few bees at a time will start huddling together and buzzing for warmth, according to their individual setpoints.\nBees are also used as an example with respect to how they choose a new hive location. Scouts go out and look for potential locations, but a single scout cannot make a decision on behalf of the entire hive. When they return to the swarm, they do a dance describing the location they have found. Other bees may be inspired to go check it out. Meanwhile, scouts from other locations are returning and doing their own dances. When enough scouts are returning and describing the same location a quorum is reached and the whole swarm will cascade to that site for a new hive.\nCellular automata are an example of how simple rules/behaviour and local interactions can produce complex large-scale results:\ncellular automata are able to capture the essence of an important phenomenon in a very exact and sparse way. By doing so, they provide a constructive proof of how simple local rules can have complex global implications. There is an alternative form of complexity that is also of interest, namely, systems where complex local behavior results in a simple global outcome.\nHe discussed the flash crash in 2010 that was driven at least in part by unforeseen interactions between high-frequency trading algorithms. It was brought under control when an automatic \"circuit breaker\" halted trading for a brief window of time.\nHis discussion of the value of circuit breakers/firebreaks in an age when so many things are interconnected like never before made me think about social media. When a single thoughtless joke can trigger a global shame mob in less time than it takes for an intercontinental flight to reach its destination, maybe a good resolution for 2019 would be to pause before sharing something negative.\nSimulated annealing is a way to introduce noise into algorithms to keep them from getting stuck at local maxima.\nSelf-organized criticality is when a system has built up enough internal energy that any further addition could trigger a cascade of any size, up to encompassing the entire system (the size distribution follows a power law). Here is a video explaining this concept. Aside from the simple sandpile model, the author gives the example of the Arab Spring which was triggered by the protest of a single merchant in Tunisia against routine bureaucratic opposition—but it resonated with enough people's grievances to start a region-wide movement.\nMiller discusses some of his own research into game theory explanations of decentralized cooperation in irrigation in Bali in Chapter 10.\nFinally, here are a few more excerpts from A Crude Look at the Whole that I found insightful:\nOur very existence relies on the complex systems that bind our food supplies to our energy networks to our global climate to every institution in our society. We have grown to a sheer size and degree of connectivity where local actions now have global consequences.\nComplex systems, whether intentional or not, are playing an increasingly important role in our world. While we might not ever be able to fully control such systems, we may be able to mitigate their downsides through the clever introduction of metaphorical firebreaks such as the circuit breakers that are used in financial markets. Our understanding of how to create such controls is lagging well behind our need to implement them, and we must quickly develop this knowledge so that the kingdom won’t be lost for want of a nail.\nAnytime we interconnect systems, we build in feedback loops. ... We often hear that some disastrous event was the result of a “perfect storm” of events. However, in a world of increasing complexity, we are simply perfecting our ability to create such storms.\nMoving on to Mitchell's book (Complexity: A Guided Tour), one of her main themes is how complex and adaptive behaviour can be produced from simple rules. Four areas she considers under this theme are information, computation, dynamics/chaos, and adaptation. Here are some things from her book that I found interesting.\nthe Web can be thought of as a self-organizing social system: individuals, with little or no central oversight, perform simple tasks: posting Web pages and linking to other Web pages. However, complex systems scientists have discovered that the network as a whole has many unexpected large-scale properties involving its overall structure, the way in which it grows, how information propagates over its links, and the coevolutionary relationships between the behavior of search engines and the Web’s link structure, all of which lead to what could be called “adaptive” behavior for the system as a whole.\nEarly in the book, major milestones in information and computation* theory are laid out with very clear explanations. These include Turing machines (as mentioned above), the halting problem, and the work of Claude Shannon. There is also a nice discussion of the Maxwell's demon thought experiment and Szilárd's answer to it (that the act of measuring increases entropy—amended by later scholars to the fact that erasing/overwriting memory increases entropy).\n* Mitchell uses computation as a technical term for the general process of \"what a complex system does with information in order to succeed or adapt in its environment.\"\nOne very interesting point was how complete prediction of deterministic systems is not possible in a complex world. This is due to the uncertainty principle, chaos theory (sensitive dependence on initial conditions), and the halting problem:\nHowever, two major discoveries of the twentieth century showed that Laplace’s dream of complete prediction is not possible, even in principle. One discovery was Werner Heisenberg’s 1927 “uncertainty principle” in quantum mechanics, which states that one cannot measure the exact values of the position and the momentum (mass times velocity) of a particle at the same time. ... But sensitive dependence on initial conditions says that in chaotic systems, even the tiniest errors in your initial measurements will eventually produce huge errors in your prediction of the future motion of an object.\nThe nineteenth century was a time of belief in infinite possibility in mathematics and science. Hilbert and others believed they were on the verge of realizing Leibniz’s dream: discovering an automatic way to prove or disprove any statement, thus showing that there is nothing mathematics could not conquer. Similarly, as we saw in chapter 2, Laplace and others believed that, using Newton’s laws, scientists could in principle predict everything in the universe. In contrast, the discoveries in mathematics and physics of the early to middle twentieth century showed that such infinite possibility did not in fact exist. Just as quantum mechanics and chaos together quashed the hope of perfect prediction, Gödel’s and Turing’s results quashed the hope of the unlimited power of mathematics and computing.\nChapters 8 – 11 are about genetic algorithms and cellular automata. Mitchell walks through some examples step by step which really helps make these topics understandable. This part of the book was my favourite. I now understand that genetic algorithms work with a large but finite set of inputs and outputs and their \"DNA\" (which is modified in each generation) encodes a table matching up input and output. The author includes a very interesting example from her own research where she used a genetic algorithm to design cellular automata rules for majority determination.\nSelf-copying programs also feature in this section. As far as I can tell, a language like Clojure, where code and data are treated as the same thing, is well-suited to this kind of problem.\nShe has an explanation of the logistic map and bifurcation.\nThe Hungarian phenomenon was a cluster of mathematicians and physicists, many of whom won a Nobel prize, who all came from a single generation in Hungary (a few of them even went to the same high school):\nVon Neumann was part of what has been called the “Hungarian phenomenon,” a group of several Hungarians of similar age who went on to become world-famous scientists. This group also included Leo Szilard, whom we heard about in chapter 3, the physicists Eugene Wigner, Edward Teller, and Denis Gabor, and the mathematicians Paul Erdös, John Kemeny, and Peter Lax.\nShe discusses how ant colonies find a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation in their search for food, without centralized command.\nComplexity: A Guided Tour has some useful comments on modelling:\nA model, in the context of science, is a simplified representation of some “real” phenomenon. Scientists supposedly study nature, but in reality much of what they do is construct and study models of nature.\n[M]odelers need above all to emphasize the limitations of their models, so that the results of such models are not misinterpreted, taken too literally, or hyped too much.\nScale laws, such as the prevalence of quarter-power scaling in biology and its possible causes (admirably, she covers multiple possibilities and makes it clear that the answer is not yet definitive), are another thing the book spends some time on.\nThe focus on the latter part of the book is networks, especially \"small-world\" and scale-free networks. Mitchell discusses ways in which these kinds of networks can arise, such as preferential attachment. Examples of networks range from metabolic pathways to epidemiology to food webs. Hubs in these kinds of networks are vulnerable (or a good point for targetted interventions, depending on your objective) but otherwise the overall structure is quite robust.\nIn addition to genetic algorithms, this book includes a couple of chapters on actual genetics. The explanation of how genes can regulate the expression of other genes—in a network structure—was interesting to learn about. Some genes can make proteins the bind to certain DNA sequences (formerly called \"junk\"), activating or deactivating nearby genes. The networked structure of these interactions leads to a great deal of complexity. Here is some of Mitchell's explanation of this topic:\nOne casualty of the molecular revolution is the straightforward concept of gene. The mechanics of DNA that I sketched in chapter 6 still holds true—chromosomes contain stretches of DNA that are transcribed and translated to create proteins—but it turns out to be only part of the story.\n...\nThe complexity of living systems is largely due to networks of genes rather than the sum of independent effects of individual genes. As I described in chapter 16, genetic regulatory networks are currently a major focus of the field of genetics. In the old genes-as-beads-on-a-string view, as in Mendel’s laws, genes are linear—each gene independently contributes to the entire phenotype. The new, generally accepted view, is that genes in a cell operate in nonlinear information-processing networks, in which some genes control the actions of other genes in response to changes in the cell’s state—that is, genes do not operate independently.\nWhere do these special regulator proteins come from? Like all proteins, they come from genes, in this case regulatory genes that encode such proteins in order to turn other genes on or off, depending on the current state of the cell. How do these regulatory genes determine the current state of the cell? By the presence or absence of proteins that signal the state of the cell by binding to the regulatory genes’ own switches. Such proteins are often encoded by other regulatory genes, and so forth.\nObviously there are a lot of ideas to digest from these books. I would like to explore some of them further. For example, I might try some simulated annealing, sandpile model, cellular automata, random Boolean network, or genetic algorithm problems to practice programming.\nWith that, I'll wrap this post up and wish a Merry Christmas to all my readers!\nPermalink",

    "content": "As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been pretty busy this fall. I took a longer hiatus from blogging than I had planned, but now I'm back at it.\nEarlier this year I moved to a new house and that has provided the opportunity to try making a couple of pieces of furniture to help fill out some of the rooms. For this post I'm sharing the designs I came up with.\nThe first item is a bracket to support a pendant light. It is partially supported with wires attached to eye bolt screws; I was inspired by the Erasmusbrug.\nHere are photos of the bracket before installation and then in use. This map is in the background.\nThe namesake piece of this post is a cabinet I made for my bathroom. It uses oak for the face frame (the plywood is poplar, although I could have used oak plywood) and has a \"mission oak\" stain. The baskets are unstained ash from Ashland. The cabinet is 30\" tall by 14\" wide by 12\" deep. The basket drawers sit on bars rather than shelves to give it an open, floating look.\nHere are some photos during construction. I first assembled the face frame, which is held together using mending plates; the bars to hold the baskets got attached to it using brackets. The box of the cabinet came next. Finally, I attached the face frame to the box, using finishing nails.\nIt still needs to be sanded and have a clear coat applied (and then have the legs secured to the slab), but I've almost finished building a coffee table for my living room. The tabletop is a live-edge slab (which came as a kit) and the legs are made from 3/4\" copper pipe.\nHere are some photos of the coffee table during construction. I used a cutting tool to get the straight lengths of pipe I needed: 6 x 15\" for the verticals, 16 x 8\" for the segments along the length of the table, and 4 x 12\" for the horizontal ties. These straight lengths of pipe were connected with elbows and tees, held in place with epoxy.\nI've also found room in my new house for some furniture I've built in the past. On the left is a side table in the kitchen, and on the right is a bookshelf and CD stand in the study.\nTo finish this post off, here are a couple of links related to a book review I wrote earlier this fall. This article is a review of a review of Factfulness, and here is an infographic on cognitive biases, some of which were discussed by Rosling in that book.\nPermalink",

    "content": "The past month I've been really busy with my job, so I haven't had much time for blogging. This post is another short one on strategies for a board game. I do have some good ideas for a few more in-depth posts this year; hopefully I'll have time to write them soon, so keep checking in.\nGo is a board game I enjoy playing and would like to get better at. The rules are simple, but the possible moves are almost infinite (there are ≈1025 possible combinations after only the first ten moves). To deal with this complexity, students of the game over the years have come up with numerous proverbs (good advice in general but not necessarily applicable to every situation) about strategy. In this post, I'll share a few that I think I have at least a rough understanding of by now. They come from this list:\nI've also been watching some videos from this playlist by Jonathan Hop. He explains different concepts of the game in 10 minutes. For example, in his video on the Endgame, he explains about sente (initiative), which is a move that your opponent has to respond to. At the end of the game, especially, it is important to consider whether a certain sequence will end with yourself or your opponent having the next stone to place.\n(If you're looking for a different kind of Proverb, click here)\nPermalink",

    "content": "As the days get shorter and colder, it's a good time of year to play board games. One of my favourites is Dominion and for this post I decided to read up on some strategies for it.\nDominion is a card game where each player has their own deck that they add to each turn. The major types of cards include money, actions, and victory points. Each turn, a player draws five cards from their deck into their hand and plays them if possible (by default, a single action and single purchase are allowed). Actions have various effects (including drawing more cards and/or allowing more actions) and money can be used to buy new cards; actions that are performed and money that is spent in a turn get placed in a discard pile and shuffled back into the player's deck when it runs out. Victory points generally have no use during the game—with too many in a deck, a player could draw a hand that doesn't allow any actions or purchases—but are required to win.\nI'll be discussing three strategies in this post. They are not original to me, so follow the links for more details.\nThe first strategy to consider is called Big Money. This strategy ignores actions and focuses on buying money (in the highest denomination you can afford), or the most valuable victory point card if you can afford it. The idea behind this strategy is that, since you only have five cards in your hand each round, you want the average monetary value to be high enough to regularly be able to afford to buy the highest-value victory point card. This requires keeping the ratio of money cards to victory point cards at the right level. This strategy is not the strongest in the game, but it is considered a good benchmark: when buying an action card you should ask whether its worth the opportunity cost of buying money and increasing your expected value of money per turn for the rest of the game.\nThe next strategy to consider is called Engine. In contrast to Big Money which aims to maximize the expected value of money in your 5-card hand each turn, Engine strategies focus on chaining actions together to go through more cards each turn. A strong engine can potentially cycle your entire deck through your hand every turn. Cards or a combination of cards that grant extra actions and extra draws into your hand are the centrepiece of this strategy. In addition to the cards that drive the Engine, you'll also need a payload: an action that benefits you (e.g. granting extra money or multiple buys) or attacks your opponents.\nThe final strategy that I'm going to mention in this post is the Rush. The game ends when three of the piles of available cards to buy have been depleted. So this strategy focuses on getting lots of cheap cards to end the game quickly before your opponents' strategies have had a chance to take full effect.\nSome people have programmed simulators to compare various implementations of these and other strategies. This one can be used online in your browser. This one has more features but requires a download (so I haven't tried it).\nI've heard from some friends that you can play Dominion online, although I've only played in person myself.\nAlso on the topic of board game strategy is this advice from Eric Raymond:\nI have a rule: when in doubt, play to maximize the breadth of your option tree. Actually, you should often choose option-maximizing moves over moves with a slightly higher immediate payoff, especially early in the game and most especially if the effect of investing in options is cumulative.\nFor Dominion, I'm not sure this is the best idea since adding cards to your deck just in case they're useful later will \"dilute\" your deck of the cards you want to draw with high probability for your core strategy. However, for other games I've written about in the past I think it's very relevant. In Ticket to Ride, developing a network with good connectivity increases the chance that future missions you draw will already be mostly fulfilled. In Privateer, increasing the speed of your ship keeps your options open for various paths to fame and riches.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Some poetry, some history, and some Maritime scenery.\nAt the end of September, I took a detour to Grand Pré after a weekend in Halifax. The landscape there is a UNESCO site, in recognition of the Grand Dérangement.\nOn October 8, 1755, the inhabitants of Grand Pré were loaded onto ships for deportation, following a month during which the men of the community were imprisoned in the parish church. The British were worried that Acadian loyalty would be a weak point in colonial wars in North America. See here for more of the history.\nThis event, and the separation of family and friends that it caused, became the basis of the narrative poem \"Evangeline\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (he also wrote \"I heard the bells on Christmas Day\"). I read this poem this summer. It follows the anguish of a young woman who is separated from her fiancee. It also has some lovely descriptions of the landscape:\nIN the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,\nDistant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand Pré\nLay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,\nGiving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.\nDikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labour incessant,\nShut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates\nOpened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.\nWest and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields\nSpreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward\nBlomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains\nSea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic\nLooked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended.\nThere, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.\nStrongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of chestnut,\nSuch as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.\nHere is a photo I took of this landcape, from the look-out on Old Post Rd.:\nThe Minas Basin, reaching toward Truro (and Debert) from Chignecto, is the part of the Bay of Fundy with the highest tides. These are referenced in some evocative passages in \"Evangeline\":\nSoon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight\nStreamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden\nSwelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.\nHalf the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight\nDeepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean\nFled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach\nCovered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.\n(The latter selection provided the title for this post).\nGrand Pré includes over a thousand hectares (2,500 acres) of land that is below high tide water level. It was reclaimed as extremely productive agricultural land from a salt marsh using dikes and aboiteaux (one-way sluices that let water out at low tide but stop backflow at high tide. This page has more about the reclamation process (also see a post I wrote about land reclamation in the Netherlands) .\nSince it's fall, I wanted to share this description of the season from \"Evangeline\":\nBees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey\nTill the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted\nCold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.\nSuch was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,\nCalled by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!\nFilled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape\nLay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.\nTo wrap this post up, here's an excerpt from \"To Autumn\" by Keats, a poem about fall that I quite appreciate:\nTo bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\nFor summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Now and then, I like to share some links I've been saving up, especially ones that relate to topics I've blogged about before.\nTo start with, here is some musical accompaniment:\nOne of my posts got shared on Reddit.\nThis video of a cheese expert guessing which cheese was more expensive was neat—I learned some things to look for in cheese. On a similar subject, here is a guide to cheese knives.\nMoving from food to drink, here is a good article about Trappist monks and their brewing (the \"labora\" part of \"Ora et Labora\").\nPlaces in Europe near ancient Roman roads tend to be more prosperous today, apparently. Is this due to path dependance of economic development, or proximity to rivers/resources/etc.?\nIn Canada, the Ottawa River was historically an important transportation route (last year, I was in Ottawa for a weekend). The map in that article is sort of a Sankey diagram since it changes the width of the line to show the river flow along its watershed.\nThis site has new maps added regularly of random things (e.g. number of cows) in Canada and the US. This article looks at the orientations of streets (i.e. how consistent of a grid there is) in multiple cities.\nWetlands are cool. Someday, I'd like to visit some of the ones listed in this article. Closer to home, here are some unique options for places to spend the night in the Maritimes.\nI've only looked at a couple of the articles so far, but this magazine issue is a conversation about charter/start-up cities, a topic I find quite interesting.\nDid you know that global deforestation is significantly slowing down? Here is an article about those statistics. It discusses the Kuznets curve, which I've mentioned before. On a similar note, this article suggests ways in which economic growth doesn't necessarily mean further intensification of non-renewable resource consumption.\nThis is an interesting review of Elinor Ostrom's book Governing the Commons (her work was cited in this book I reviewed). It's about organically-formed local institutions to avoid the tragedy of the commons; it includes discussion of the governance of groundwater and irrigation districts. Here are a couple of excerpts from the review:\nAll in all, it seems that organically grown institutions are a lot like Hayek's free markets. They are information-processing machines. They aggregate countless details, too small and numerous for any central planner to take into account, and generate a set of efficient governance rules.\nI like the idea of treating the creation of an institution (i.e. the rules governing the usage of the basin) as an infrastructure project, similar to a dam.\nThis messy process of developing governance for groundwater resources can be seen in action in a recent New York Times' article about the Sulphur Springs Valley in Arizona. I wanted to share several paragraphs from this article to convey a sense of the situation:\nPart of the reason groundwater mining in the valley hadn’t forced a reckoning earlier, he said, was that water was ubiquitous to the point of being invisible. Local farmers were never required to put meters on their wells, he pointed out, which meant that nobody knew exactly how much water was being pumped, much less how much was left. “Long term, people say we should search for a solution,” he said, “but they don’t want to be the ones to suffer.”\nSeated at his desk, Searle reached and opened a glass cabinet, lifting out arrowheads and a stone ax blade that he dug out of his ranch over the last 50 years. “You know, we weren’t the first ones here in this valley, and we weren’t the first ones struggling with water,” he said. His face turned pensive, and he spoke for a time about the ancient Hohokam and Tohono O’odham tribes, which traversed this part of the Sonoran Desert for thousands of years without digging deep wells. “But the mining industry isn’t a long-term industry,” he continued. “Name me a long-term mining community. Ajo, Pearce — those are ghost towns. Pecos was like this: a natural resource mined until the town fell apart around it. If we die, it’ll be a slow one. If the whole county dries up, it’ll be just a blip on the radar.”\n...\nMost groundwater rights in Arizona are still based on the frontier legal doctrine of “reasonable use,” which holds that a landowner retains the right to pump as much water as he or she pleases, so long as it’s put to a “reasonable use” such as farming. In 1980, Arizona became the first state to pass groundwater reform, effectively deeming groundwater a public rather than a private resource. But in the years since, few regulatory safeguards have extended beyond the boundaries of Tucson and Phoenix. Outside those places, little has changed since statehood in 1912: A farmer needed only to file an Intent to Drill notice and pay a $150 permitting fee and was then free to pump as much as desired. For valley farmers, growing high-water crops like alfalfa and nuts, this often meant about 2,000 gallons, roughly the capacity of a tanker truck, every minute, 24 hours a day, with only intermittent breaks for several months. In 2017 alone, one farm pumped 22 billion gallons, nearly double the volume of bottled water sold in the United States annually.\n...\nFor the next year, the farmers met monthly for four hours, ironing out a proposal for a “withdrawal fee” on agricultural wells — the word “tax,” Seitz says, was carefully avoided — plus a freeze on large-scale irrigation and a limit on high-water-use crops. In effect, they would create a management zone, protecting the aquifer, and by extension their own farms, from deep water exploration by new and corporate competitors. They had only just begun to finalize the proposal in the early spring of 2015 when word of the closed-door meetings began to spread. Many felt any restriction on water would devalue property and, worse, deal yet another blow to the declining self-rule of rural culture. Townspeople arrived at committee members’ homes at all hours, accusing them of theft.\nAs someone working in the water industry, I don't think the situation will get to the point depicted in Paolo Bacigalupi's novel The Water Knife (which I enjoyed reading). For the small quantities of water needed by households, water delivery is feasible (albeit an added expense that families would prefer to avoid as the Times' article shows); for agriculture, they'll have to start accounting for the real cost of water (rather than treating it as something that can be pulled out of the ground in unlimited quantities) just like any other input. A lot of industry is already moving toward such a perspective.\nPermalink",

    "content": "If you're looking for a break from the doom-and-gloom in the news, this post is for you (I'll also suggest this one from last year). Below, I share reviews of two books—so it won't be a short read and I'd recommend grabbing a cup of coffee. Factfulness by Hans Rosling tries to convey a more accurate picture of the state of the world than most people have, and develop a mental toolkit for avoiding misconceptions. Soonish by the Weinersmiths looks into some emerging—and some far-out—technologies and their potential.\n\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and it's just going to keep happening\"—if this is something you've said or thought, you should read Factfulness to learn about not only the factual errors with this statement, but also the fallacious mental instincts (Rosling labels some of them the gap, negativity, and straight line instincts) that makes this view of the world so easy to buy into. The real picture looks more like this:\nOver the past twenty years, the proportion of the global population living in extreme poverty has halved. This is absolutely revolutionary. I consider it to be the most important change that has happened in the world in my lifetime. It is also a pretty basic fact to know about life on Earth. But people do not know it. On average only 7 percent—less than one in ten!—get it right.\nHans Rosling was a dedicated global public health educator. You may have seen some of his TED talks. When he was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he threw himself into writing this book (together with his son and daughter-in-law).\nFactfulness is recommended by Bill Gates (see here for a interactive chart of books he's recommended). As alluded to in the provocative introductory paragraph, this book not only presents the data on ways in which global conditions are improving, it also points out mental instincts people have that make it difficult to see the big picture clearly. For example, our minds like to take shortcuts by fitting situations into a dramatic narrative, which often involves conflict between two groups. When people say things like \"the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer\", they're dividing the world into two groups and interpreting the situation as a dramatic conflict. This instinct to overdramatize hides the fact that most people (and most countries) don't belong to either group but rather fit in the gap (this gives the name to Rosling's website Gapminder). In the introduction, here is how Rosling summarizes the actual situation around the world and how it differs from our perception:\nThings are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer; and the number of poor just keeps increasing; and we will soon run out of resources unless we do something drastic. At least that’s the picture that most Westerners see in the media and carry around in their heads. I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world’s population lives somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated, they live in two-child families, and they want to go abroad on holiday, not as refugees. Step-by-step, year-by-year, the world is improving.\nThe chapters in the book are each structured around a particular error-prone mental instinct. At the end of each chapter, after describing the factual situation, there is a short section on how to replace some instinctual mental shortcuts with ways of thinking that make it easier to see the forest for the trees.\nI won't have space in this review to cover every chapter, but I want to take some time to describe the \"gap\" instinct, the topic of Chapter 1. The gap instinct is,\nthat irresistible temptation we have to divide all kinds of things into two distinct and often conflicting groups, with an imagined gap—a huge chasm of injustice—in between. It is about how the gap instinct creates a picture in people’s heads of a world split into two kinds of countries or two kinds of people: rich versus poor.\n...\nBy dividing the world into two misleading boxes—poor and rich—it completely distorts all the global proportions in people’s minds.\nRegardless of what terms you may use (e.g. Developing Countries, Third World, Global South), Rosling is against dividing the world in two. Factfulness has graphs showing that such a division was valid in the 1960s, but things have changed since then and we've failed to update our mental models:\nEighty-five percent of mankind are already inside the box that used to be named “developed world.” The remaining 15 percent are mostly in between the two boxes. Only 13 countries, representing 6 percent of the world population, are still inside the “developing” box. But while the world has changed, the worldview has not, at least in the heads of the “Westerners.” Most of us are stuck with a completely outdated idea about the rest of the world.\nI really appreciated that instead of just criticizing the common mental map of the world, he proposes a new one. Instead of dividing things in two, he outlines 4 levels. This emphasizes that it is a continuous distribution rather than a sharp dichotomy. The book tries to describe in practical terms (such as food and transportation) what it means to live on $1, $4, $16, or $64 dollars per day.\nFactfulness has a lot of graphs. The graph Rosling calls his favourite can be seen on his interactive website. It is a scatterplot of life expectancy versus GDP for all the countries of the world, represented as circles proportional to their population. With a historical trail added for his home country of Sweden, you can see that when he was born (1948), conditions in Sweden were on the same level that they are in Egypt now.\nHere is a similar graph highlighting Canada's trajectory. Most countries in the present day are above Canada's historic trail. This is because improved health—especially reduced infant mortality—has spread around the world more quickly than wealth. As Rosling explains:\nBut today people in Afghanistan and other countries on Level 1 live much longer lives than Swedes did back in 1863. This is because basic modernizations have reached most people and improved their lives drastically.\nOf course, GDP and life expectancy aren't the only things to value. While he loved data, Rosling kept the big picture in mind:\nthe end goal of economic growth is individual freedom and culture, and these values are difficult to capture with numbers*.\n*although he does suggest guitars per capita as a proxy measure for culture and freedom\nA valuable aspect of Factfulness is the advice it gives to temper our understanding of statistics and the media. Here is a sample:\nyour secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality.\nAlongside all the other improvements, our surveillance of suffering has improved tremendously. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite.\nWhen you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking, If there had been an equally large positive improvement, would I have heard about that?\nPractice distinguishing between a level (e.g., bad) and a direction of change (e.g., better). Convince yourself that things can be both better and bad.\navoid lonely numbers. Never, ever leave a number all by itself. Never believe that one number on its own can be meaningful. If you are offered one number, always ask for at least one more.\nWith his background, Dr. Rosling is able to provide clear projections of population trends and projections. I learned that the number of children born each year has already peaked, and future population growth will come from the \"fill-up effect\" as current cohorts age:\nThe UN experts are not predicting that the number of children will stop increasing. They are reporting that it is already happening.\nThe large increase in global population in the twentieth century was due to a transition from one \"balance\" (Dr. Rosling got too up close and personal with child mortality in his career to have any rose-coloured glasses about \"balance with nature\") to another:\nOn average four out of six children died before becoming parents themselves, leaving just two surviving children to parent the next generation. There was a balance. It wasn’t because humans lived in balance with nature. Humans died in balance with nature. It was utterly brutal and tragic. Today, humanity is once again reaching a balance. The number of parents is no longer increasing. But this balance is dramatically different from the old balance. The new balance is nice: the typical parents have two children, and neither of them dies. For the first time in human history, we live in balance. [emphasis added]\nAs people around the world rise out of extreme poverty, remaining ignorant of how the world is changing could mean missing out on huge business opportunities. Rosling points out that the vast majority of people around the world have received basic vaccinations, which implies that the logistics in their countries are good enough to make refrigerated deliveries.\nThe number of people on Level 3 will increase from two billion to four billion between now and 2040. Almost everyone in the world is becoming a consumer. If you suffer from the misconception that most of the world is still too poor to buy anything at all, you risk missing out on the biggest economic opportunity in world history.\nthe best places to invest right now were probably those African countries that had just seen decades of rapid improvements in education and child survival. I mentioned Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Ghana.\nAside from international investment, he recommends travelling to places at different levels to see how other people really live (here is an interview with someone else who also suggests to young people to go to Africa with an eye on opportunities).\nTowards the end of the book, Rosling has some comments on climate change, which he sees as an important challenge to tackle, that are worth sharing. Apparently Al Gore asked him to use his presentation skills to raise awareness of climate change. But he thinks exaggeration and the \"urgency instinct\" are counterproductive for solving complex and abstract problems, so he set out some conditions for his participation:\nI insisted that I would never show the worst-case line without showing the probable and the best-case lines as well.\nData must be used to tell the truth, not to call to action, no matter how noble the intentions.\nModelling and forecasting are topics I've written about before (and complexity is a topic I'm planning to read and write about in the coming months), so I found these comments interesting:\nSome aspects of the future are easier to predict than others. Weather forecasts are rarely accurate more than a week into the future. Forecasting a country’s economic growth and unemployment rates is also surprisingly difficult. That is because of the complexity of the systems involved. How many things do you need to predict, and how quickly do they change? By next week, there will have been billions of changes of temperature, wind speed, humidity. By next month, billions of dollars will have changed hands billions of times. In contrast, demographic forecasts are amazingly accurate decades into the future because the systems involved—essentially, births and deaths—are quite simple. Children are born, grow up, have more children, and then die.\nThe one chapter that I might disagree with a bit is the one about the \"destiny\" instinct. This chapter reminds readers that cultures can change, and aren't destined to stay stuck in poverty. This is certainly a worthwhile reminder; I'd contend, however, that cultures can also drive change and promote innovation (and this is probably most important on the leading edge of Rosling's bubble graphs, where there are no working models to look to for further progress). Additionally, I wonder if his own destiny instinct made him assume that each country, in the long run, would keep progressing on various quality-of-life metrics.\nOverall, Factfulness is a fantastic book, and one I'd widely recommend.\nSoonish is written by the husband and wife team of Kelly and Zach Weinersmith. It is subtitled \"Ten Emerging Technologies That'll Improve and/or Ruin Everything\". It is quite different from the other book reviewed in this post—about technology rather than human development, and with a lot of humour sprinkled in. Even though it covers some cutting-edge concepts, it is a fun read. And although the authors certainly include some cautionary notes about how the technologies they discuss could be misused or have unintended consequences, the book has a very optimistic tone overall:\nSo why write this book? Because there are amazing things happening all over the place every day, all the time, and most people aren’t aware of them. There are also people who become cynical because they thought we’d have fusion power or weekend trips to Venus by now. (p. 7)\nThe technologies discussed in Soonish include:\nI'm going to breeze quickly through most of these technologies, and then have a couple of general comments on the book.\nSpace flight is not a new technology, but it is not cheap because many rockets are built to be used once and they have to carry all their fuel with them from the ground (which adds weight, which requires more fuel...). Making reusable rockets is one way that space flight could become more affordable:\nIf you could make the launch vehicle recoverable, you could potentially eliminate 90% of the cost of space launch. Or, if you could use just three quarters as much fuel, you’d be able to fit six times as much cargo, instantly dividing the cost per pound by six.\n...\nBut there is reason to hope that a better reusable launch vehicle can be created. As we were writing this chapter, SpaceX became the first company to successfully put cargo into space, then land part of its rocket. If it really can bring the price down, this may prove to be the biggest development in space travel in a generation. (p. 18)\nOther technologies under development or on the drawing board (at least of some dreamers) for improved travel to space include synergetic air-breathing rocket engines, rocket sleds, using lasers to reduce air drag in front of a rocket, aircraft-launched rockets (check out this video modelling a Stratolaunch in Kerbal Space Program), and a space elevator.\nThe chapter on space flight also told the crazy saga of Dr. Bull, a Canadian rocket scientist who eventually went to work for Saddam Hussein and got assassinated (presumably by the Mossad).\nIf you can get to space more easily, there might be unprecedented mineral wealth available for mining from asteroids. This is how it is described by Daniel Faber:\n“There are asteroids that are made completely of metal, like natural stainless steel, nickel, and iron and . . . the smallest one we know in a near-earth orbit is 2 kilometers across. It goes by the glorious name of 1986 DA and it contains in it more than thirty times the amount of metal that humanity has ever mined on earth. And that’s one. And then, there are thousands of those. That’s the smallest one that is in a near-earth orbit.” (p. 53)\nWhen it comes to programmable matter, they mention the HygroScope (seen in the following video) which uses the way wood expands and contracts with changes in humidity to make a dynamic structure.\nHygroScope - Centre Pompidou Paris from Achim Menges on Vimeo.\nA more easily controllable example of programmable objects is origami robots:\nOrigami robots are a good starting place for programmable matter, since paper is relatively easy to manipulate and because you can build up complex structures from simple folding rules. There are a number of ways to make origami robots, but the basic principle is simple: You have a flat material that permits a certain set of folds. Along those folds there are actuators—a fancy word for a machine part that can move—that cause the fold to fold itself. The “paper” contains the circuitry to talk to a computer, so you can simply program the robot to bend along the right folds at the right times. (p. 105)\nSmall, simple, and cheap robots could be linked in swarms that obey simple rules but can collectively have complex behaviour (like termites or cellular automata). This would allow for very generalized forms of reconfigurable objects.\nSoonish describes how the construction industry is exceptional in the way that it hasn't been subject to much outsourcing or automation compared to other industries:\nEven with modern materials and prefab housing methods, if you want to build a house, you still need to have a team of skilled workers come to a particular location and put it together by hand. This is weird. No, really, it’s weird. You’re just used to it. Take a look around you—how many items do you see that were put together by hand, locally, by skilled workers? That IKEA bed frame you built over the course of six months doesn’t count. Much of the stuff you see was made quickly and cheaply by a computerized manufacturing process. Why can’t we do the same for houses? (p. 136)\nConstruction robots (either for specialized tasks like brick-laying, or eventually perhaps general tasks) and large-scale 3D printing have the potential to drastically reduce construction costs, which would be handy in places where that (rather than demand for land) is the main driver of housing costs.\nThe chapter on synthetic biology (i.e. cutting-edge genetic modification) was very interesting. It starts off by pointing out that humans have been indirectly shaping the genes of plants and animals for a long time:\nWe’ve gotten pretty damn good at altering biology. One time, we took a single species called Brassica oleracea and turned it into every vegetable you hated as a kid—brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, collard greens. YES. All one species, slowly modified over generations into a thousand okay-tasting forms, each more cheese-requiring than the last. We do this to animals too. Remember when we took the noble wolf—spirit of the forest and tundra—and converted it into a shivering, bug-eyed rat, dependent on the nearest blond socialite for diet kibble and a pink sweater? There is no greater expression of man’s dominion over nature. (p. 191)\nMuch more powerful and direct techniques are available in the present. They have a lot of applications in biotechnology. For example, modified bacteria can be used for producing biofuels:\n[C]ellulose chains are pretty hard to break down into tasty sugar molecules. Unless you have specially developed enzymes to break down cellulose sugar, you can’t digest it. This is why cows have complex digestive systems—they’re doing God’s work of converting stubbornly hard-to-digest grass into beef.\nBut doing your business inside a cow is never a good way to go. So, Dr. Aindrila Mukhopadhyay's group at the Joint BioEnergy Institute created bacteria that can convert renewable plant resources (like switchgrass) into d-limonene, a precursor to jet fuel. Her group’s modified bacteria can take pretreated switchgrass, break the cellulose into little sugars, then turn those sugars into d-limonene. (p. 210)\nThe Weinersmiths do raise some cautionary points about the power that genetic modification has:\nHaving a pot of bacteria that churns out jet fuel is fine, but what happens if the bacteria gets loose and starts doing its thing in a river? The hope is that these bacteria, which are designed to work under particular and unusual conditions, wouldn’t do well in the wild. (p. 218)\nThe final few chapters were about various technologies related to health and medicine. They were all interesting, but I'm just going to touch on 3D printing organs in this post. The function of our organs depends not only on the cells they comprise, but also on their structure. 3D printing can potentially replicate that structure:\nFor example, the lung’s surface for gas exchange with your bloodstream has the area of a tennis court all folded up and packed inside your chest. So there’s simply no way to make a functional replacement for an organ if we can’t recreate at least some of that amazing architecture.” (p. 261)\nThe strength of Soonish is in its clear descriptions of the emerging technologies it covers. The Weinersmiths obviously did a lot of research to understand them themselves. I also appreciated the humour, although in places I did find the writing a bit too twee (but that's totally subjective, I realize).\nTo finish this post off, here are a few strips I like from the comic that Zach Weinersmith draws:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I was thinking this summer about when I was half as old as I am now. That year I went to a Royal Canadian Air Cadet summer camp to learn how to pilot a glider. I dug out some photos and decided to share them here.\nThe camp, Regional Glider School – Atlantic (RGS-A), included both theoretical and practical instruction on flying an unpowered aircraft. The classroom parts (and the accommodations) were held at Nova Scotia Agriculture College while the actual flying took place at Debert airfield (if you look closely there is a former continuity of government nuclear bunker near the airfield on the eastern side).\nThe classes include learning about aerodynamics—lift, thrust, weight, and drag—radio communications, and weather, among other topics. I also remember a lot of drilling on the correct way to move the control stick and rudder pedals if you found yourself in a stall or spin.\nAt the airfield, there were far fewer gliders than trainees. However, no one was bored while waiting for his or her turn. Since gliders have no power of their own, the only way for one to \"taxi\" from where it landed back to the line-up for taking off is to get a few people to grab the struts and push.\nFlying in a glider starts (after completing a safety checklist) with getting towed to a suitable altitude. At Debert, a small powered airplane did the towing, but I also experienced getting towed by a car at a different airfield. Once you release the tow line, you're slowly falling toward the ground for the rest of the flight. Well, more precisely you're falling relative to the air and can actually gain some elevation in a strong updraft (a thermal or a wind deflected up a mountain) but practicing this was outside the scope of our training. The SGS 2-33A* gliders that we flew in have a glide ratio of 22:1, so even starting from a few thousand feet would allow you to fly a loop of a dozen miles or so. One of the interesting aspects of flying a glider is that your attitude (i.e. pitch) is directly coupled with your speed; pushing forward on the control stick pitches the nose down, causing the glider to speed up, while pulling back pitches the nose up, shedding speed—and if you lose too much speed you'll also lose lift and stall. Turning involves using both the ailerons and the rudder to roll and yaw in a coordinated manner (rolling and yawing in an anti-coordinated manner is a good way to lose a bunch of elevation in a hurry). After a bit of practice these movements on the control stick and rudder pedals became almost as natural as riding a bike.\n*At the Udvar-Hazy Center I saw a Grob 102 glider that had set an altitude record (over 49,000 ft.). It was much more streamlined than the SGS 2-33A.\nOver the course of that summer I logged a bit over 7 hours flying with an instructor and a bit over 3 hours flying solo. The title of this post is the registration of the glider I had my first solo flight in.\nHere are a few old photos I found and scanned. They show taking off, getting towed to release altitude, and landing:\nAnd here's one of me in the cockpit of a glider:\nIf you find yourself in the Debert area, the Masstown market makes for a worthwhile stop.\nPermalink",

    "content": "On a recent weekend I had a day-long layover in Toronto (deliberately). I took the opportunity to check out a couple of museums there: the Aga Khan museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario.\nThe Aga Khan may be best known in Canada for controversy around gifting a vacation to the Prime Minister. However, he also established a museum in Toronto that exhibits some of the arts and culture of the Muslim world. A natural point of comparison is the Institut du monde arabe in Paris. That museum has a broader collection (it also stretches much further back in time—the Aga Khan Museum didn't have many artifacts from before 1000 A.D.) while the Aga Khan Museum has a more appealing building (see the photo below of its architecture).\nOutside the museum there were some displays about the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme, intended to revitalize some historic precincts in cities around the Muslim world. I didn't spend very long looking at them, but it sounds like an interesting initiative.\nInside the museum, some of the most plentiful artifacts were ceramic bowls of various styles. Some of them had nice calligraphy on them. I'd like to become more acquainted with different styles of Arabic calligraphy (I really like the appearance of square kufic although I didn't see any examples at the Aga Khan Museum).\nThe written word was also on display in numerous manuscripts in the museum's collection, such as these two produced in 17th century Iran. The one on the left is an anatomy book (from a 14th century source) and the one on the right is an astronomy book (from a 10th century source).\nOther manuscripts included a copy of 1001 Nights (labelled as 101 Nights in English and Arabic, but 1001 in French) from 13th century Spain and a richly-illustrated copy of the Shahnameh (a number of pages were displayed individually to show some scenes of interest). I also learned about muraqqa, a kind of scrap-booking popular in the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires.\nA market scene in a manuscript from late 16th century Pakistan, thought to have been illustrated for the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, reminded me of this article about the history of trade in the Middle East.\nAs a fan of tiles, this fountain from 16th century Syria was probably my favourite artifact in the museum. It would not have looked out of place in the Alhambra.\nHere is the description of this fountain from the Aga Khan Museum:\nWater plays an important role in Islamic architecture for its cooling effects and its aesthetics. Fountains were part of domestic interiors in Egypt and Syria from the time of the Mamluks to the Ottomans and after. They were restored as needed, and sometimes new fountains were assembled using pieces of fountains from different periods. The fountains were originally embedded in the floor.\nSome final artifacts that are worth mentioning are a couple of intricate wooden doors and an astrolabe.\nOne thing I appreciated about the Aga Khan Museum was that the artifacts on display were presented according to their geographic origin. This added some helpful context. My impression was that Persia was the region best represented.\nWhen I was at this museum there was also a temporary exhibit that I looked at briefly. It had a bunch of treasures from the Deccan Sultanates and Mughal Empire. These included a lot of jeweled weapons (e.g. Katar daggers); the whole exhibit was too opulent for my tastes.\nThe Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) has a lot in common—especially when it comes to its permanent collection—with the National Gallery in Ottawa. Which is to say that it has a strong presence of works by Krieghoff, James Morrice, the Group of Seven and Tom Thomson (I've also seen a lot of their work at the McMichael Gallery), Emily Carr, and other well-known Canadian artists.\nIt would take multiple visits to properly take in everything at the AGO, so I'm just going to share some art that stood out.\nThere were a couple of full rooms dedicated to Cornelius Krieghoff's paintings. I love the detail and vitality of his work:\nLawren Harris also had a dedicated room or two at the AGO:\nHere are some paintings by J.E.H. MacDonald and William Kurelek:\nBecause I like the poem, I appreciated this painting of the Lady of Shalott. One of MacDonald's few urban paintings (Tracks and Traffic, 1912) was also neat to see.\nA big part of the AGO is the Thomson collection. This includes paintings, but also ship models (such as this one) and carved diptychs and prayer beads, among other things. I spent some time looking at an intricate carved prayer bead (a 3 – 4 cm diameter sphere that opens to show two Biblical dioramas) from 1500s Germany. The skill and labour that went into 14th century diptychs—and not in small number, considering how many were in a single museum that's not even in Europe—made me wonder if the late middle ages should be considered a golden age in Europe (by analogy to artifacts I had seen earlier that day from the Aga Khan Museum that reflect a similar level of development of material culture and are considered to come from an Islamic golden age).\nThe highlights of the AGO are definitely the works of some of the classic Canadian artists mentioned in the introductory paragraph above. In contrast to the milieu in which those works were produced, contemporary artists have a lot more institutional support; however, at least personally, it's hard to see a corresponding increase in the calibre of art being produced with the influx of grant money. I don't want to sound overly critical though, so before wrapping this post up, I'll mention a contemporary work that I liked: some horn-shaped sculptures by Rebecca Belmore that had been installed along the shore at some national parks (Banff, Pukaskwa, and Gros Morne) before being moved to the AGO. Here are some wave sounds that were recorded to accompany these sculptures.\nFinally, there are some upcoming temporary exhibitions at the AGO that look like they would be worth seeing: Anthropocene (the artist behind Anthropocene had an exhibit at UNB this spring but I didn't make it out) and Impressionism in the Age of Industry.\nPermalink",

    "content": "The past couple of weeks I've been on some business trips and haven't had time to write any posts. However, I did have time on a flight to read a technical paper that I want to discuss below (I also finished reading a book that I'm planning to review in an upcoming post).\n\"Biofilms, active substrata, and me\" (2018) is a paper by Dr. Bruce Rittmann in Water Research. This journal now has a number of \"... and me\" papers, which seem to basically be review papers focused on the author's own research. The authors of these \"... and me\" papers are prominent researchers who have contributed greatly to the field; Dr. Rittmann was recognized with the Stockholm Water Prize this year.\nI've previously posted about another \"... and me\" paper. Before I get into discussing the current one, I wanted to share a blog post that the author of that paper, Dr. Simon Judd, wrote recently that extends some of the points from there about bridging the gap between research and application in the wastewater treatment field. Here is a cliche he says should be avoided by future papers in this sector (but read the whole thing—disclosure: it favourably mentions the company I work for):\nCliché no. 2: Almost as infuriating is: ‘this [technology, technique …] offers much promise for wastewater treatment in the future’. This manages to tick three boxes at once in that it is (a) aspecific, (b) hackneyed, and (c) almost certainly untrue − unless the ‘promise’ is to go the way of most other bench-scale tests reported in the academic literature.\nTo start with, here is the opening of the abstract for Rittmann (2018):\nHaving worked with biofilms since the 1970s, I know that they are ubiquitous in nature, of great value in water technology, and scientifically fascinating. Biofilms are naturally able to remove BOD, transform N, generate methane, and biodegrade micropollutants. What I also discovered is that biofilms can do a lot more for us in terms of providing environmental services if we give them a bit of help. Here, I explore how we can use active substrata to enable our biofilm partners to provide particularly challenging environmental services. In particular, I delve into three examples in which an active substratum makes it possible for a biofilm to accomplish a task that otherwise seems impossible.\nBiofilms are communities of microorganisms growing in a thin layer on a surface (their substratum). Apparently 90% of microorganisms in nature live this way, as opposed to freely floating around. They are held together—and protected—by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), a kind of \"glue\" they excrete. Aside from the protection offered, biofilms have the advantage that different microorganisms can work together; chemical substances can diffuse to different depths, creating micro-niches along their gradients that are ideal for different types of microorganisms. In engineered systems, biofilms have the further advantage that they are less prone to wash-out than free-floating biomass:\na biofilm is an excellent means to retain microorganisms. For treatment technology, retention is of the utmost importance when critically important microorganisms are slow growers. ... e.g., methanogenic archaea, nitrifying bacteria, anammox bacteria, and dechlorinating bacteria.\nThis point is also made by Speece in his book Anaerobic Biotechnology and Odor/Corrosion Control for Municipalities and Industries:\nOne of the paramount issues in the design process of anaerobic reactors for a particular wastewater is the selection of the most appropriate method of immobilizing the biomass. The major advantage of anaerobic technology—low biomass yield—is also its major disadvantage when trying to increase the biomass inventory.\nRetention of the biomass is indispensible for successfully maintaining the low synthesizing methanogens. (p. 307)\nActive substrata*, the focus of this paper, are \"surfaces that provide an essential service to the microorganisms\". This service can be supplying, removing, or transforming a chemical species involved in the biochemical reaction carried out by the microorganism.\n*To avoid confusion note that substrata and substrates are not used as synonyms. The former are the surfaces that biofims grow on and the latter are chemicals eaten or respired (the distinction blurs a bit when discussing single-celled organisms) in microbial metabolism.\nThe concept of \"microbial infallibility\" (mentioned in this post) implies that almost any substrate can be degraded by some kind of microorganism. Rittmann (2018) considers some examples where they need a boost.\nThe first example is a membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) that supplies hydrogen gas (H2) directly to a biofilm growing on a membrane. This process is similar to a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) except for the gas supplied through the membrane. The purpose of supplying hydrogen instead of air is to assist the biofilm in degrading oxidized contaminants. Traditionally, reduced contaminants have gotten more attention in environmental biotechnology. Reduced contaminants are known as electron donors (ED) since they have surplus electrons that they need to give up to be stabilized; biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) falls into this category. For biochemical reactions to take place, electron donors must be paired with electron acceptors (EA), or oxidized compounds—in the vast majority of cases, oxygen is supplied via aeration to stabilize reduced contaminants. However, for oxidized contaminants (e.g. nitrate or perchlorate), an ED must be supplied instead:\nWhen an oxidized contaminant is to be a respiratory electron acceptor, its reduction becomes possible only when the bacteria oxidize an electron-donor substrate. The electron-donor substrate has to be supplied as part of the treatment technology.\nThe conventional example of this is adding methanol for denitrification (i.e. reducing nitrate), but the MBfR represents a novel approach. Rittmann describes how H2 meets the criteria of a good electron donor: bioavailable, relatively inexpensive, and able to be dosed accurately (since residual ED = added BOD). To get these advantages in spite of its low solubility, the MBfR uses just-in-time delivery by diffusion through a membrane that supports a biofilm on its wetted side.\nThe second example is a microbial electrochemical cell (MxC). While the first example used a membrane as the active substratum, this process uses an anode in that role. The anode acts as a \"solid-phase electron acceptor\"; rather than an oxidized chemical participating in the biochemical reaction, an electrical circuit is used as a direct electron sink.\nAnode-respiring bacteria can act as living catalysts at the anode of an electrochemical cell ... Anode-respiring bacteria (ARB) are able to oxidize an electron-donor substrate and respire the electrons to an conductive solid.\nThis requires extra-cellular electron transfer (also discussed in a previous post), which can occur via direct contact, soluble electron shuttles, or a conductive biofilm matrix. The third one is the focus in Rittmann (2018) due to the biofilm angle.\nMicrobial electrochemical cells are a generalization of fuel cells. Each configuration generally has the same process occurring at the anode (i.e. reducing BOD) which makes ARB very relevant to study. Various beneficial reactions can be driven at the cathode, so they are a flexible and promising platform.\nThe third example in Rittmann (2018) is intimately coupled photobiocatalysis (ICPB). In this example, the active substratum is a porous media with a light-stimulated coating. When UV light hits this coating, it generates hydroxyl radicals, which are strongly oxidizing and can break down compounds that are otherwise refractory/recalcitrant. Processes that generate hydroxyl radicals are known as Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP). ICPB is a hybrid between AOPs and biological processes: bacteria are sheltered in the pores of the media—protected from the UV light—to further degrade the compounds that the hydroxyl radicals have started to break down. By applying a \"small degree of advanced oxidation that makes recalcitrant organic pollutants readily biodegradable\", it combines the strengths of AOPs and biological processes to get decent removals without outrageous costs.\nIn summary, the active substrata in the three examples discussed were membranes that H2 can diffuse through, solid anodes, and porous media with a light-activated coating. The one thing I felt this paper was lacking was a more explicit statement of the stage of development for each example. The author said that MBfR technology has been applied commercially and ICPB has been demonstrated (for MxC technology I think it varies widely based on the cathode configuration), but I'd like to know quantitatively the largest scale each one has been used on.\nI also recently listened to a podcast interview (29 min.) with Dr. Rittmann that touched on the same topics as the paper (my recollection is that all three examples from the paper were at least mentioned). Here are some notes I took from that:\n*conventional WWTPs use a lot of energy to run aerators to satisfy the oxygen demand in the wastewater\nThere are a couple of other episodes from the same podcast that I've listened to recently that are also worth checking out (approx. 20 min. each):\nFinally, if microbiology interests you, here is a blog to take a look at. This post was an interesting read.\nDisclaimer: This is just a reminder that the views expressed in this blog are mine alone; I write it in my own capacity and not as part of my job.\nPermalink",

    "content": "The weekend that just passed was the New Brunswick Day long weekend here. As in previous years I wanted to get out and enjoy some of the natural beauty in the province.\nDeer Island is one of the inhabited islands in the Bay of Fundy. I went there for a day and went on a sea kayaking tour with Seascape. It was a fantastic day to be on the water and a great place to explore in that way! We were out for around 5 hours (including a stop on an island for lunch) and I'd estimate we covered around 15 km.\nTo the east of Deer Island there are a bunch of smaller islands (mostly uninhabited). This archipelago lies between the Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy proper, and the channels between the islands have strong currents that change with the tides. It is not an area I'd go without a guide; the guide from Seascape Tours was very knowledgeable and was able to direct us on a route where we weren't fighting the currents or the wind (that rose to 10 – 15 knots in the afternoon) too hard.\nThis part of the bay is an extremely productive marine environment. While out sea kayaking, I saw a bunch of porpoises and seals (harbour and grey seals), and even a Minke whale (from further away than the other marine mammals). (Unfortunately, these marine mammals didn't stay in one place long enough to get out my camera). Last year, I went on a whale watching tour in the same area and didn't see any, but that was a month earlier in the year (August is the peak month, I think) and this year I've heard of a lot more whale sightings (even from ferries). The herring run is apparently also really strong this year and it makes sense that whales would follow their food into the bay.\nI've been kayaking in the Bay of Fundy before, but further into it at St. Martins. To compare the two areas, I'd say the inner bay has more spectacular geology while the outer bay has more richness in terms of biology.\nHere are a few photos from Deer Island:\nPaddling past some herring weirs:\nPart of the archipelago:\nThe beach* where we had lunch:\n*I believe this beach was on Barnes Island. Our route also took us past Nubble Island, Simpsons Island, and Beans Island, if I recall correctly.\nThe ferry back to mainland NB:\nTo wrap this post up, here are a few related links:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I was recently down in northwestern Virginia on a business trip. Because I was there over a weekend, I had the chance to do a couple of hikes in the area.\nOne spot I went hiking was in Shenandoah National Park. While there, I drove the northern third of the scenic Skyline Drive and hiked the Overall Run Falls trail (approx. 10 km, starting from the Hogback Overlook on Skyline Drive). This trail follows the route of the Appalachian Trail for a short distance and the Tuscarora Trail the rest of the way to a series of waterfalls. Here are some photos I took in this national park:\nThe next day, I went to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. This is a historic town (with well-preserved buildings from around 150 years ago and costumed re-enactors) in a gorgeous setting at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers. Its strategic location—upstream from the US capital at a gap in the Appalachian mountains—gave it a role in many historical events. The Lewis and Clark expedition was outfitted from an armoury there, some radical abolitionists attempted an uprising, and a Civil War battle saw the largest surrender of US troops until the Second World War (at Bataan). Harpers Ferry is near the mid-point of the Appalachian Trail; the C&O Canal towpath (now a trail that follows the Potomac River from Washington D.C. to western Maryland) also passes through the historic park. This canal was built shortly after the Erie canal (which was discussed in a couple of books that I've read) and was intended to provide a transportation route into the interior of the continent. Aside from occasional locks, the section I saw looked like little more than a wide ditch with an adjacent path (originally for animals to walk as they towed boats); its significance is more impressive than its appearance. Not being an American, I wasn't as interested in the Civil War history of Harpers Ferry as in the natural setting and infrastructure history. While there, I hiked up Maryland Heights (after crossing the Potomac River on a bridge that is part of the Appalachian Trail; the round trip was around 8 km, I think). Here are a few photos from Harpers Ferry:\nThe upper image is of a water-powered pulp mill with a 15 tons per day capacity. The lower image shows the remains of a lock on the C&O canal. Next is a panorama of the town from Maryland Heights:\nOn my trip to Virginia I flew into Dulles airport. When I arrived, I wasn't in a hurry, so I paid a visit to the Udvar-Hazy Center. This aviation museum is part of the Smithsonian and is well worth visiting. The highlights were seeing a space shuttle (Discovery) up close as well as an SR-71 Blackbird.\nHere are photos of the space shuttle and the SR-71 (note the ramjet engines!):\nThe part of Virginia I was in is in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The sensitivity of the bay environment to excessive nutrients means that effective wastewater treatment is in demand. Some previous business trips have taken me to another part of that watershed, along the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania.\nIt looks like the rest of the summer is going to be very busy with my job, but I have some topics in mind that I plan to post about when I have time: a technical paper on biofilms, some book reviews, and some outdoor recreation closer to home.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is my final post based off of my trip to the Netherlands. It focuses on reviewing a book about land reclamation and flood control infrastructure in the Netherlands and sharing a couple of bike trips I took out into the countryside around Amsterdam and Rotterdam to see some of this infrastructure, among other things.\nDesigned for Dry Feet by Dr. Robert Hoeksema is a book about flood control and land reclamation infrastructure in the Netherlands. It is based on a field course the author taught; it seems to be written for an engineering audience, but the content is accessible enough for anyone with an interest in the topic. I read it on my trip and found it increased my insight and appreciation for the landscapes I was seeing. The topic of the book was also timely closer to home, given the 2018 floods in New Brunswick.\nDesigned for Dry Feet has ten chapters. The first one provides a historical overview. The next seven chapters delve into specific types of flood protection or land reclamation technologies, or projects in specific parts of the country. These range from building mounds to locate the cores of settlements above flood plains, to the creation of an entire province on reclaimed land in the 20th century. The second last chapter discusses the governance of this infrastructure by water management boards and a national authority. The final chapter lays out some suggested self-guided driving itineraries for seeing many of the sites mentioned in the book.\nI'm going to start by sharing Dr. Hoeksema's definition of a \"polder\" since it is key to understanding the Dutch landscape:\nToday’s Dutch lowland landscape consists of hundreds of water management units called polders. A polder is an area completely isolated from the surrounding area, usually by a berm, dike, or embankment, in which the groundwater levels are artificially controlled. This control involves a variety of drainage schemes—usually ditches and canals that deliver the water to the perimeter of the polder. The water is then released from the polder using a pump or sluice. A pump is needed if the water outside the polder is always higher than the water inside the polder. If the water outside the polder is occasionally lower than the water inside, then a sluice can be used. (p. 1)\nBefore polders began to be used, there were efforts to increase the amount of useful land by draining peaty areas (a lot of peat was also harvested for fuel or for salt extraction). However, soils—especially water-logged peat—inevitably subside/compact when they are dried out. Thus a lot of these early efforts inadvertently created lakes (e.g. near Haarlem and Beemster); these lakes caused a lot of erosion of the surrounding areas when winds off the North Sea whipped up large waves.\nThe next step in land reclamation was building dikes around areas that were sometimes (e.g. at low tide) above water level and letting them drain through sluices that would close to prevent flow back in when water levels rose. Only later did active drainage (with windmills and later steam or diesel pumps) come into play. Until reading this book and travelling to the Netherlands, I didn't realize just how much of the land there has been reclaimed. This .gif provides a visual summary.\nThe basic approach to reclaiming land into a polder was as follows:\nTo successfully drain a lake, those in charge of the project had to follow several steps. First, they cut off any connections to and from the lake and redirected existing streams around the lake. Next, they dug a ring canal around the perimeter of the lake and used the spoils from the canal to build a dike between the canal and the lake water. In some places, low areas on the outer side of the canal were also filled. Next, an outlet for the ring canal was found. Outlet canals were usually dug connecting the ring canal to a receiving water body. (p. 35)\nI was impressed by this excerpt from the contract for Beemster polder (from the early 17th century) because including a performance test is a savvy feature in contracts even today:\nAnd to make sure that the reclamation can be carried out by means of sixteen windmills for drainage, the contractors have accepted and promised, just as they hereby accept and promise, that they will pass tests of their invention full-size, in the presence of the Delegates of the Landowners in the polder within a period of four weeks at most. And if it is found that the sixteen windmills for drainage are not capable of doing the work, the contractors will be held to provide themselves immediately with more old or new windmills up to the number the Delegates see fit. (p. 45)\nWindmills are believed to have been invented in the Middle East, but the technology was heavily improved and refined in the Netherlands. Designed for Dry Feet describes different types of windmills, such as tower mills (where only the cap at the top is rotated to face the wind) and post mills (where the entire mill house can be rotated to face the wind). Windmills were applied to grinding grain and then adapted for pumping water out of polders.\nSome men who were influential in the development of land reclamation practices during this era were Vierlingh, Stevin, Leeghwater, and (a bit later) Cruquius.\nThis post will get too long if I try to talk about everything, so I'm going to skip over coastal flood protection and the huge undertaking reclaiming land from the Zuiderzee (a 50 year project that increased the amount of land in the country by 5%). Those sections were certainly interesting, but they're about parts of the country I didn't really get to see on this trip.\nPerhaps the most interesting chapter in Designed for Dry Feet is about the Delta Works project. It consisted of the construction of a number of dams and barriers throughout the delta (of the Rhine–Maas system) in the southwest of the country. The structures involved are shown in the following diagram (used here for review purposes only):\nThe trigger for the Delta Works project was a huge flood in 1953, brought on by a storm surge that coincided with a spring tide, that killed over 1800 people. It was finally completed in 1997 (the original plan was to finish in 1978). Because this work occurred more recently than many of the other projects in the book, Dr. Hoeksema is able to provide a lot of detail on how it was implemented. The smaller structures were constructed first, allowing the lessons learned from them to be applied to larger challenges. During the liberation of Holland at the end of the Second World War, the Allies bombed some dikes. The gaps were closed by sinking excess military hardware. This technique was adapted for the Delta Works, with pre-fabricated caissons being floated into place than sank and filled for the constructions of barriers and dams. Other techniques included preparing the river- or sea-bed by placing fascine mattresses, and building up causeways with cable suspended rock drops.\nBlocking flow from the sea had some unintended environmental consequences, so the plan for the project was adapted (one of the benefits of proceeding one stage at a time!) so that some of the main barriers would be normally open and only close when necessary to prevent inland flooding (e.g. during storm surges):\nIn the early 1970s changes were made in the design of the Oosterschelde Dam. Concerns were raised about the impact that this structure would have on the unique Oosterschelde estuary environment. The clean, salty water of the Oosterschelde provided a rich feeding ground for many types of animals. Mussel and oyster farming took place in this area on a large scale. The mud flats, salt marshes, and sandbars were an important habitat for birds. ... This rising concern about the environment sparked a great national debate about the direction to be taken in the Delta. Should the Delta Plan continue with its philosophy of safety over everything else or should accommodations be made for the environment? This question was answered with a redesign of the entire Oosterschelde Dam. Instead of a structure that created a permanent barrier, an open structure was built. The new barrier design allowed the tides to continue to flow in and out of the Oosterschelde and closed the area off only in the event of a storm at sea. The new barrier design used 62 steel gates, which could be raised or lowered in the event of a large storm. (p.115)\nIn addition to the hard infrastructure built as part of the Delta Works, there is now a policy called \"Room for the River\" that seeks to reduce damage from flooding by leaving more space as a floodplain.\nI didn't rent a car during my trip, but I still wanted to see some of the places Dr. Hoeksema described. So I found ones that were close enough to the cities I was staying in that I could see them while out biking for the day. In the next part of this post, I'll describe the routes I took and some things I saw, especially as it relates to what's in the book. Whether or not these specific routes appeal to you or not, one of my top recommendations for anyone else going to the Netherlands is to get on two wheels and spend some time outside of the cities.\nThe Netherlands has a great network of bike paths with good signage that makes it easy to navigate. This website has a convenient tool for planning routes. I used that tool to make the following map of the approximate loop I took from Amsterdam (and the one below from Rotterdam):\nLeaving from Centraal Station, I started heading west. I went through Westergaspark then parallel to a highway to reach the town of Halfweg. There is a steam-powered pumping station with a little museum that is mentioned in Designed for Dry Feet there (unfortunately, it was closed when I went). I then crossed a bridge over the ring canal into the Haarlemmermeer polder (at Zwanenburg). It's hard to capture in a photo, but in person you can easily notice that the land inside the polder is lower than the water in the ring canal. Other pumping stations lift water from drainage ditches inside the polder to the ring canal (the one at Halfweg was used for lifting water from the ring canal to a level where it could drain to the Noordzeekanaal, I believe). From Halfweg, I headed back toward Amsterdam but turned north and went past the OBA bulk terminal to catch the ferry (free for cyclists) to Zaandam. Biking through the town got me to the attraction of Zaanse Schans, where there are a number of operational windmills, along with other aspects of traditional Dutch rural regions on display (such as a cheese shop). I went in a couple of windmills that were making mustard and pigments. These windmills were not described in the book as they are used for milling rather than pumping, but a lot of the features are similar.\nOn the way back to Amsterdam, I mostly followed the LF7 route (one of the national long distance cycle routes). It goes through some beautiful countryside including through Twiske park, past a memorial to some Allied airmen who died in WW2, and then along the Noordhollandsch Kanaal.\nHere are a few photos from this biking excursion. From top to bottom, it shows the pumping station at Halfweg, windmills at Zaanse Schans, and some of the landscape along LF7:\nHere are some other ideas for biking day trips around Amsterdam.\nHere is the approximate route I took when I went biking from Rotterdam:\nAfter renting a bike, I started by going to Station Hofplein to get some breakfast (from Lokaal Koffie). That is where the crowdfunded bridge I mentioned in my post on Rotterdam is located. After fueling up for the ride, I headed out of Rotterdam along the north bank of the Nieuwe Maas. My first destination was the Hollandse IJssel storm surge barrier, which was the first structure in the Delta Works project. Next I continued through some fields to Krimpen aan de Lek where I took a ferry across to Kinderdijk. The polder landscape I was biking through is really unique and quite lovely. It’s basically not at all \"natural\", but I’m not sure I’ve seen such a diversity of waterfowl anywhere else. There are also plenty of cows, goats, and sheep—grass-fed so they'll make delicious cheese, presumably. At Kinderdijk there are 19 traditional windmills still in operation; they comprise a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These windmills lift water from the polders on either side to storage canals (\"boezems\"). More modern pumps are used to perform the second lift into the Lek river so it can drain to the ocean. During the disastrous flood of 1953 the fields in this area were under at least 3 or 4 metres of water; a level stick by one of the windmills showed the dramatic height of the floods as well as the normal level of the river, which still requires a significant lift to drain the fields.\nThe route I took was great with respect to seeing places mentioned in Designed for Dry Feet because I was able to see a traditional site at Kinderdijk as well as a modern flood protection barrier (part of the Delta Works project) at Krimpen aan de IJssel, all in a short bike ride from Rotterdam. I was enjoying the biking, though, so I decided to extend the route by continuing on to Dordrecht. At Papendrecht, I caught the waterbus across to Dordrecht, then transferred to the one to Rotterdam. The waterbus was a fun way to travel, especially on stretches of the Maas where there is room for the pilot to open up the throttle.\nHere are some photos I took along this bike route, showing the storm surge barrier, windmills at Kinderdijk (there were some behind me that lift water from the lower drainage ditch on the right to the \"boezem\" on the left; the visible windmills on the left pump into another boezem that is obscured by tall grass), and travelling back to Rotterdam on the Waterbus:\nHere is Dr. Hoeksema's description of the Hollandse IJssel Storm Surge Barrier. He includes a similar description for each recommended site to visit:\nThis was the first structure completed as part of the Delta Plan. It is a storm barrier used to close off the Hollandse IJssel River. There is no visitor’s center or exposition, but there are good places to get a close look at this structure. (p.122)\nHere are some other ideas for biking excursions around Rotterdam.\nI'll note that I also briefly saw the Maeslant storm surge barrier—the last structure in the Delta Works project to be completed—when the bus (#713) back from the beach at Hoek van Holland drove past it. It consists of two halves that can be swung into place and then sunk to block the flow. Apparently the ball joints at the pivot points have a 10 metre diameter.\nThere were many places described in Designed for Dry Feet that I didn't see on this trip, but would like to someday. Some of the spots that stand out are more of the Delta Works structures in Zeeland, the Biesbosch national park in an area that is not reclaimed (it used to be settled but the dikes were destroyed in a flood in 1421 and not rebuilt), some of the coastal dunes and dikes, and places around Flevoland like the Ramspol inflatable dam and the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve in an artificial environment (lack of predators is an issue there apparently). Also Friesland and the Waddenzee, and the artificial land extending the Port of Rotterdam.\nThe Dutch are justly famous for maximizing the useable space in a country that would be mostly underwater if nature took its course; the techniques and projects discussed in Designed for Dry Feet show how they've done that through the centuries. Looking forward, the approach may shift to floating architecture—building on the water instead of trying to remove it. Seasteading mentioned some examples, such as the floating pavilion I showed a picture of in my post on Rotterdam and a neighbourhood in Amsterdam that includes a number of floating houses. I took the tram (line 26) to take a look at this neighbourhood (Steigereiland) while I was in Amsterdam:\nPerhaps neighbourhoods like this will become more common as Dutch efforts to keep their feet dry continue.\nIf you found this post by searching for \"historic caissons\", or something along those lines, then you may be interested in a presentation I saw at a conference last month:\n\"Case Study: History and Refurbishment of 145-Year-Old Rail Bridge Piers, Southwest Miramichi River Bridge in Miramichi, NB\", CSCE 2018.\nThe famous engineer Sandford Fleming was involved in the original project and preserved detailed notes. The authors also managed to find some archival photos of these bridge piers under construction, some of which are included in the linked paper (although the presentation had more) and it was fascinating to see the construction techniques of that era.\nI also had a short case study to present at this conference. I made some Sankey diagrams (following this tutorial) for it, although the timeslot was too short to use them in my presentation:\nPermalink",

    "content": "In my posts about travelling to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, I mentioned that I'd be discussing some maritime museums I visited in a separate post. This is that post.\nSeafaring has been an important part of Danish and Dutch history, and even their present economies. Consequently, both Denmark and the Netherlands have a number of museums dedicated to this history. I visited a couple of them in each country and thought it would be interesting to describe them all at the same time and draw some comparisons.\nMy favourite museum discussed below is the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde (a venerable town that can be reached via a 25 minute train ride from Copenhagen). It is narrowly-focussed and experiential. The national maritime museum in Amsterdam takes a broader approach but also does an excellent job presenting history—and some future possibilities.\nOf the museums covered here, this one stands out for having the most notable architecture. It was designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group to fit in an old dry dock so as not to block views of the Kronborg castle. As a result, the whole museum has the shape of a ship.\nThe maritime museum (Museet for Søfart) is only one of the things to see in Helsingør, so it makes a good destination for a day trip from Copenhagen (about 45 minutes away by train).\nHere is a picture of the museum:\nMy favourite exhibits were a room filled with old navigational instruments, ship models (dispersed throughout the museum in semi-chronological order; reading the accompanying specifications revealed a definite trend toward larger capacities and smaller crews), and a temporary exhibit called the \"Magic Box\" about modern trade in shipping containers. Denmark has a prominent role in the modern shipping industry so this part of the museum was very informative.\nHere are some navigational instruments for determining latitude (on the left; the right hand side is a room of navigational instruments from the Dutch National Maritime Museum):\nOne of the other navigational tools in their collection (not pictured) was a Polynesian stick chart. I've mentioned Polynesian navigation a couple of times before. I've also previously mentioned that I like seeing old sextants and astrolabes. And another museum I've been to that has cool ship models was the Armada museum in Madrid.\nThe Viking Ship Museum (Vikingeskibsmuseet) in Roskilde was built around five Viking-era ships that were recovered from the bottom of the fjord there. The whole museum revolves around presenting, preserving, researching, and interpreting this single discovery and as a result it has a lot of depth. The five ships (2 warships, 2 trading ships, and a fishing vessel if I recall correctly) were scuttled in the fjord almost 1000 years ago to block the most direct approach to Roskilde—allowing for more of a warning in case of an attack*—and the cold water preserved them very well.\n*Roskilde was the capital at the time, and the museum had a diorama and play-by-play timeline of how a hypothetical attack from Oslo might have played out.\nThe museum has 3 parts: a building housing the preserved ships, along with interpretive plaques; a workshop area where people use tools of that era (down to details like rope-making) to build replicas of the ships; and a harbour that contains completed replicas. Here are photos from each of these zones:\nThe Viking Ship museum offers short excursions on the replica ships (the one in use when I went was a fishing or trading vessel, not the longship) they've built. The day I went was sunny with a light breeze, so it was very pleasant. We rowed out of the harbour then raised the sail. The experience (the feel of the oars and the sound and smell of the sail) is almost enough to make one want to get a small number of friends, a medium-sized ship, and a large axe and go seek fate or fortune.\nThe research the museum does includes analysis on the wood of the ships (to determine where and when they were built) as well as \"experimental archaeology\" (which I've mentioned in a different context here)—by building replicas they can acquire data on the amount of labour and resources needed to build one and by sailing them they can determine the crew requirements and the speeds that can be reached. The replica longship in their collection (30 m long by 3.8 m wide with a 1 m draught and 26 ton displacement) has made the crossing to Ireland as part of this research.\nThe interpretive plaques in the museum gave a lot of information about Vikings, including this note on weapon complements for their ships:\nAccording to mid-11th-century Norwegian law, the standard weaponry on a warship had to consist of 1 bow and 24 arrows per thwart and a shield, a broad-axe, a sword and a spear per man.\nOverall, this was a really impressive museum; the chance to go briefly sailing on one of the replicas was a superb experience.\nHet Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam is the largest museum on this list. As such, it has room for some diverse exhibits. Some of the notable ones were navigational instruments (pictured above), a 1648 map by Blaeu, a model and statistics of the modern Port of Amsterdam, marine paintings, and the whaling industry.\nHere are a couple of the marine paintings in the museum's collection. The one on the left is by Van de Velde the Elder and the one on the right is by his son:\nAn especially interesting gallery told the story of the Dutch Golden Age. It was fitting to have that exhibit at the National Maritime Museum, since shipping (inland shipping on barges, international trade by the East India Company, naval power, and Amsterdam as a busy entrepot) was such an important contributor to Dutch power and prosperity at that time.\nAt the quay of the museum there's a replica of an East Indiaman ship. It has a length of 48 m and a beam of 11.5 m and 42 guns. It was fun to tour the decks, but it didn't impress me as much as the Viking ship replicas discussed above for some reason—perhaps because they're still sailed regularly whereas this replica remains in the harbour.\nAnother gallery promoted \"game-changing\" innovations from the Netherlands in the maritime space. These ranged from de Groot's concept of the oceans as international territory to an unmanned boat that captures garbage to clean up harbours. This gallery also had an art exhibit by Sjoerd Knibbeler called Fixed Flow. It consists of prints produced by exposing the wakes of 3d-printed ships onto photographic paper:\nWaves and Beaches by Willard Bascom explains the importance of studying wakes:\nMuch of the power expended in propelling a ship goes into wave-making and anything that can be done to reduce these waves results in increased efficiency and is of direct economic importance. Consequently some of the greatest names of hydrodynamics are associated with the ship-wave problem, including Bernoulli, Lord Kelvin, Rankine, and the Froudes. (pp. 121 – 122)\nHere is a video about this art exhibit:\nThis museum is featured in the national canon.\nMy visit to the Maritiem Museum Rotterdam was quite brief (around an hour). The exhibits I saw included one on houseboats (mainly in Dutch), the museum's \"masterpiece\" collection of maps, paintings, and ship models, and a really thoughtful exhibit about the capture of the last VOC fleet. The loss of these ships and their cargo contributed to the end of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). They were captured by the English; the Netherlands had been occupied by France at the time (during Napoleonic Wars, I think), so the English saw Dutch ships as suitable targets—but the Dutch returning from Asia were unaware of this and were taken by surprise off the coast of St. Helena. The exhibit was a good demonstration of how the same events can be perceived differently by different sides, because viewpoints of English and Dutch people who were involved were shown on the opposite sides of a set of banners:\nProbably the highlight of this museum is its collection of old barges and other ships in the harbour outside the main building (which you can walk around without a ticket):\nThis museum also seemed to have a lot of activities for kids.\nOn my trip I passed through Hamburg and noticed that it also has a maritime museum, but I wasn't there long enough to visit it. Halifax also has one that I haven't been to for a long time, but might try to visit again to compare to these ones.\nIf you're interested in naval history here's a blog you might want to check out.\nI'm planning to write one more post discussing things I did on this trip. It will be about biking in the Netherlands and ways the Dutch have dealt with living below sea level in places.\nPermalink",

    "content": "The second part of my visit to the Netherlands was spent in the Rotterdam area (there are a lot of \"'dam\" places in the Netherlands; I also passed through Zaandam and Schiedam). In this post I'll share some of the highlights of my time there.\nRotterdam is the busiest port in Europe. It sits just inland of where the largest portion of the flow from the Rhine River (called the Nieuwe Maas at that point) enters the North Sea. Because Rotterdam was heavily bombed during the Second World War, it is a much newer city (in terms of its built environment) compared to Amsterdam. As a result, it is known for its contemporary architecture (it's one of the few places in Europe that has a similar vibe to Chicago in that sense). The areas around Rotterdam are intensely agricultural (see this National Geographic article about Westland for some indication); I had some very good cheese while I was there and enjoyed biking through some polders.\nWhen I travel to other countries, I like getting beyond the main tourist locations. Rotterdam gets plenty of tourists (it has a big cruise ship terminal), but, in contrast to Amsterdam, when you go to a restaurant most of the other guests are locals. During my time in Rotterdam, I stayed in a very cool floating hotel.\nHere are my top 5 experiences from Rotterdam and the surrounding area:\nOther things I did in Rotterdam included going to the beach at Hoek van Holland* and a brief visit to the maritime museum.\n*From the metro station at Schiedam I took bus 711 to the beach and bus 713 back, but I think the metro line is getting extended to the beach soon.\nHere are some photos and notes from my time in Rotterdam:\nHere are the Erasmusbrug and the \"periscope building\", as seen during the harbour tour. I've also included a photo of a LNG-fueled barge and a container ship being unloaded in the Waalhaven:\nThis collection shows some of the architecture in Rotterdam (left to right, top to bottom): the cube houses are quite well known; the Willemsbrug is another bridge not far from the Erasmusbrug (the \"Happy Pontist\" blog has a whole series on bridges in Rotterdam; since he was there, a new pedestrian bridge was built via crowdfunding); a floating pavilion for events and a floating forest art installation; the floating hotel I stayed at; Sint Laurenskerk, which was badly damaged during WW2 but restored afterwards (I lit a candle and said a prayer for peace inside because it seemed fitting); the skyline of the Wilhelminapier. Here are a couple of articles on architecture in Rotterdam.\nOutside and within the Markthal:\nHere is a view of Delft from the Nieuwe Kerk. Willem van Oranje was assassinated in Delft and buried in that church. Other well-known figures connected to Delft include Hugo de Groot, Vermeer, and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. The Technical University of Delft does some world-class water research.\nOn my last full day in Rotterdam, there was an opportunity to access rooftops around the city. It would have been cool, but I already had plans. If I'm ever back in that area, other things that I didn't fit in on this trip include kayaking in the Biesbosch National Park (on the waterbus route a bit past Dordrecht), taking a longer harbour tour out to \"Futureland\", and renting a boat in the inner harbour (a spot I had supper one night has hot tub boats for rent).\nFor my next couple of posts, I'm planning to go into more detail on some of the naval/maritime museums I visited in Denmark and the Netherlands and then on some flood control infrastructure, etc. I saw while biking around the countryside.\nPermalink",

    "content": "After Denmark, I travelled to the Netherlands, where I spent some time around Amsterdam and Rotterdam. In this post I'll share about what I did in the Amsterdam area; I plan to feature the Rotterdam area in my next post.\nAmsterdam flourished during the Dutch Golden Age in the 17th Century, and the legacy of that period forms the foundation of its cultural appeal—of course there is plenty of cool stuff from more recent times there too. The Dutch Golden Age, as I understand it, was a period with a lot of conflict and external threats (they were involved in seven wars in Europe in the 17th Century, plus other conflicts around colonies and overseas forts) but new-found political independence and serious dynamism in business and the arts. The people were industrious (the reputed \"Protestant work ethic\") and Reformed spirituality shunned conspicuous consumption, leading to large surpluses. Along with wealth, the Dutch Republic accumulated colonies and a powerful navy. The Ascent of Money discussed how Amsterdam had the world's first stock market. Part of my inspiration for wanting to go there was reading some novels set in Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age: The Coffee Trader and The Baroque Cycle.\nLike I did when I went to Paris a couple of years ago, I found it beneficial to get a city card in Amsterdam (and also in Copenhagen) to combine the admission to a bunch of museums and venues. My accommodations were at the ClinkNOORD hostel, which was in a very convenient location just a 300 m walk and a free ferry ride from Centraal Station.\nAs with my previous post, I wanted to share my top five experiences from this city:\nI'm planning separate posts to describe the maritime museums I visited on this trip and biking out to see windmills and polders, but here are some photos and notes from the other things I saw and did in Amsterdam:\nThese photos look across the IJ in both directions, North and South:\nFrom left to right, these photos show going on a boat tour, a sculpture in Rembrandtplein of the \"Night Watch\" painting, and a cheese store. Normally I prefer paintings to sculptures, but I thought this 3D adaptation of a Rembrandt painting was really cool. At the cheese shop shown (Kaaskamer), the line was too long so I didn't get anything there—but one of the great things about downtown Amsterdam is that you don't have to go far at all to find another cheese shop.\nHere are a few paintings from the Rijksmuseum. In the top left is one of the Golden Bend by Berckheyde. In the top right is a painting of a windmill pumping water from a polder by Paul Joseph Constantin Gabriel. The two-panel painting on the bottom illustrates the St. Elizabeth's Day Flood, with water rushing through a ruptured dike (next to the ships). Other notable works in the Rijksmuseum include ship paintings by van de Velde (father and son), the Hall of Honour, and Rembrandt's \"Night Watch\". The latter is in a room with six other paintings (by other artists) of civic guard companies that were all commissioned for the militia headquarters. I find it remarkable that the prominent citizens of that time period took such pride in defending their city to commission these artworks. In the Rijksmuseum, I also saw a few paintings of peasant celebrations that made me wonder if those artists had had influence on Cornelius Krieghoff, since he has scenes of people partying and making mischief that have a similar feel to them.\nThe NEMO Science Museum has cool architecture and a great observation deck on its roof (I didn't go inside, just climbed up to enjoy the view). Here is the Scheepvaartmuseum, with its replica East Indiaman, seen from that vantage:\nMicropia is a one-of-a-kind place. Through microscopes, prepared slides, culture plates, multimedia, and other exhibits it shows visitors various microorganisms and their activities. The photos below (clockwise from the top left) show cyanobacteria, leaf cutter ants (not microorganisms, but fun to watch for sure), yeast, and a display on algae and the products they're used in. Personally, I was looking for nitrifiers but I didn't see any. The day I went to Micropia, I basically saw all of the kingdoms of life because I also went to de Hortus botanical garden and the Artis zoo. The giraffes and some playful alpine ibex kids were the highlights at the zoo.\nThe Van Gogh Museum doesn't allow photos, so I don't have any from there. (If you go, also note that you have to book a ticket in advance for a specific timeslot). His paintings are really incredible to see in person—some are sublime, honestly. The museum was also really well laid out to show the development of his style and also the course of his personal life. In addition to paintings by Van Gogh, it displayed some paintings by his friends who influenced his style. \"October\" by Daubigny was one that I really appreciated. While I was there, the museum had an exhibit on how Van Gogh was influenced by Japanese artistic styles. He had a large collection of woodblock prints from Japan that he studied and tried to duplicate (compare this to the Hiroshige painting it is based on). The exhibit showed some Japanese art, discussed some of its elements, and then showed Van Gogh paintings that applied the same elements. Key elements included expanses of a single colour, strong contour lines, and bold diagonal elements.\nOn my last day in Amsterdam, I had lunch at Cafe de Ceuvel. It is a spot that takes recycling to new levels. They have old houseboats that have been brought onto land to be used as offices or workshops and they even make biogas from their waste (on a boat!).\nIf I'm in Amsterdam again, there are some different neighbourhoods I'd like to explore such as Jordaan and De Pijp. I'd also like to rent a boat on the canals and/or do some kayaking (in the city or nearby rural areas). Texel also sounds like a nice spot to visit in the surrounding area.\nAfter my stay in Amsterdam, I went briefly to Utrecht then on to Rotterdam. Utrecht is a picturesque city, but I wasn't really there for long enough to do much, so I don't have anything to write about it.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I didn't have a post last week because I was returning from vacation. In the next few posts, I'll be writing about the places I went: Denmark and the Netherlands.\nAs the title says, I stayed in Denmark for five nights. My accommodations were in Copenhagen (at Bedwood, a hostel with a great atmosphere), but on a couple of days I took daytrips to other towns. Copenhagen was founded in 1167 (so after the Viking age) by Bishop Absalon. Due to its position at the entrance to the Baltic Sea, trade and shipping have always been of high importance to Copenhagen. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was a busy entrepot for triangular trade with overseas colonies (Denmark had a colony in the Caribbean, forts in West Africa and India, and a trading concession in Canton, China); in the early seventeenth century, King Christian IV expanded Copenhagen with the Christianshavn merchant district (old warehouses can still be seen in this part of the city), which he based on Dutch-style urban planning. In modern times, international trade remains prominent in Copenhagen: the shipping giant Maersk accounts for 2.5 percent of Danish GDP.\nFive days definitely wasn't enough time to see everything in the Copenhagen area, but from what I was able to do here are my Top 5 things:\nOther things I did in Copenhagen that are worth mentioning were going to some museums (the National Museum, the Designmuseum, and the Danish Architecture Centre), the aquarium, the historic Carlsberg brewery, and the Round Tower.\nHere are some photos and notes from some of the places mentioned above:\nCopenhagen has a lot of waterfront due to the harbour and the canals. These pictures (starting in the top left) show Nyhavn, the Kalvebod Bølge (a recreation-oriented boardwalk), and a panorama (from BLOX, the home of the Danish Architecture Centre, on the left to the Library on the right):\nHere's a photo from the kayak tour I went on, approaching the Cirkelbroen:\nWhen I went biking around part of the harbour loop, this is the approximate route I took (the original image comes from Copenhagenize):\nAt the Nationalmuseet, some notable exhibits were on bog bodies, Vikings (but only a few rooms—I was hoping for more), and Arctic culture (Greenland is a Danish territory). The following images show some of the artifacts I found interesting. Silver coins from a Viking cache that bear Arabic inscriptions show how far their trade routes reached. Polynesian stick charts are used for navigation. The traditional kayaks and kayak tackle reminded me of a documentary I've watched about traditional hunting practices from kayaks.\nAt Visit Carlsberg, I went on a self-guided tour of the old brewhouse, which included a lot of displays on their history. While I was in the neighbourhood, I also went to see the laboratory where Johan Kjeldahl (memorial pillar pictured in the inset) worked. He came up with a test for organic nitrogen that still bears his name. There is another memorial there for Emil Hansen, who also worked at that laboratory and was the first to isolate a pure culture of yeast.\nOn daytrips from Copenhagen I visited Helsingør and Roskilde. These photos show the castle and cathedral in these towns, respectively; both of these are UNESCO-listed. For the maritime/ship museums I visited, I'm planning a dedicated post later.\nThe highlight of the Designmuseum was a room that was filled with chairs. It's neat to see some much care put into the design of such an everyday object. While I was there, they also had an interesting exhibit on influence between Danish and Japanese design.\nA couple of things that looked neat but I didn't have time to do on this trip included art museums like the Glypotek, and architecture tours from DAC. It would also be great to spend more time biking around the city and boating (whether by kayak or something else) on the canals and harbour.\nAfter my time in Denmark I took a train to Amsterdam, passing through part of Germany on the way. In Hamburg, I had enough time to go see the Speicherstadt, the Elbphilharmonie, and a few historic churches, and to get some currywurst for supper. In my next post I plan to describe my time in Amsterdam.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I've reached a big milestone on my blog: this is the 200th post. I thought this would be a good time to look into how well-connected various posts are. The list of links at the bottom of this page makes a good starting point for a dive into the archives.\nTo determine how the posts in my archive are interlinked, I wrote a script in Ruby (called interlinktally.rb) to open each post (URLs were in a text file with one on each line) and use a regular expression to find links to other posts (I use relative URLs for links to other posts, so they are easy to distinguish) and list the matches in a file:\nNext, I put the links to/from each post into a table in Excel (I did this part manually, although a script would have been more convenient). This is the bottom section of the table, showing links between recent posts.\nObserve how most of the links are below the diagonal (every post links to itself) because I only go back and add links to posts written after a certain post if they are part of a series (like the block of links among the entries in my series on Seven Languages in Seven Weeks) or if I've mentioned an upcoming post. You can also see that the \"year in review\" post links to every post from the previous year.\nI graphed the number of links to and from each post (the ones going off the scale are the Year in Review posts) as well as the geometric average of the two numbers (to give a sense of how much area the links cover within the space of the whole set of posts). Taking the average evens out the fact that earlier posts have more time to accumulate links back to them, and later posts have a larger pool of previous posts on similar topics to link to.\nAside from the Year in Review posts, a post listing some important rivers had the most links back to it, and one about parks had the most links to other posts.\nIf I'd had time to do more with these results, I could have tried to analyze the adjacency matrix or to draw the network graph of the best-connected posts.\nHere are the top twenty posts by geometric average (i.e. the top 10 percent best-connected). I've excluded the Year in Review posts, links posts, a previous milestone, and multiple entries from the same series:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Last weekend I visited the Beaverbrook Art Gallery to check out a couple of exhibits. It had just re-opened after being closed due to flooding.\nFirst of all, here is what the art gallery looked like at the end of April 2018. The flood waters were up to the building, but some well-designed flood gates kept the sunken patio from filling up with water.\nThe main exhibit I went to see was by Dan Xu. She applies Chinese artistic styles and techniques to landscapes from New Brunswick.\nThese paintings have a lot of fine detail, so a low resolution image doesn't do them justice. Go see them for yourself if you have an opportunity. I'd certainly like to see more of her work.\nThe art gallery also had an exhibit on James Morrice (I actually saw the same exhibit in Ottawa last fall). He was a Canadian artist in the post-impressionist era who travelled widely, as the following map shows:\nHis work includes some nice street scenes from Paris and Tangiers.\nWhile I was at the gallery I also looked at some of the paintings from the permanent collection (they have an excellent collection from Krieghoff) and another current exhibit by Alex Janvier. A lot of his paintings were too abstract for my usual tastes (although he did have a few impressive representational works on display) but they display some serious talent.\nReturning to the topic of the Saint John River flood this year, I made a comparison to the flooding ten years ago by overlaying the hydrographs of 2008 and 2018 freshets. This year, the level rose much faster and stayed more than a metre above flood stage for longer; the peak level reached was about the same between the two years, though.\nIf you enjoyed this post, you might be interested in this one from last year about a sculpture that interacts with the rising water levels. And here is another NB art post.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post contains 2.1 book reviews. The two books are The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates by Peter T. Leeson and The Sea Wolves: A History of the Vikings by Lars Brownworth. The extra 10 percent is two chapters from David Friedman's book Legal Systems Very Different from Ours (not yet published, but freely available in draft here).\nThe Invisible Hook has the basic premise that many infamous pirate behaviours can be explained in terms of rational self-interest rather than assuming they were all vicious psychopaths. In some cases, their self-interest led to arrangements that are more in line with modern values than those of their contemporaries. I felt like the central thesis of this book was strong, but it could have gotten the point across in a shorter length; it gave wordy explanations of straight-forward concepts and was a bit repetitive between chapters.\nLeeson discusses economic themes such as the principal-agent problem (which pirates were mostly free from compared to merchant crews since they didn't have a ship-owner on land to answer to), signalling/reputation (using the jolly roger flag and occasional acts of brutality to encourage most of their targets to surrender without a fight), and responding to incentives (pretending to be recruited against their will to avoid hanging if caught). The Invisible Hook also has a lot to say about pirate constitutions (the Articles that an entire ship would agree to be governed by) and democracy.\nThe Invisible Hook \"covers pirates from about 1670 to 1730\" (mainly in the Caribbean) and it takes the following perspective:\nPeglegs and parrots aside, in the end, piracy was a business. It was a criminal business, but a business nonetheless, and deserves to be examined in this light.\nSince pirates were outlaws, they operated outside the scope of government regulations. To prevent their criminal enterprise from imploding, they regulated themselves instead. Pirate regulations, which were privately and voluntarily adopted, were successful because they were private and voluntary. Pirates had a better idea about the kinds of regulations their ships needed than outsiders did. They knew, for instance, that it was important for them to restrict smoking in the hold but unimportant to ban smoking altogether. Pirates had what economists call “local knowledge” of their particular circumstances and how various rules were likely to affect life aboard their ships.\nProbably the strongest part of the book concerns pirate government (with their codes and democracy, at a time when those were rare among legitimate governments). Like any ship, pirate ships had captains:\nMany important piratical decisions, such as how to engage a potential target, the method to pursue when chasing a target or being chased by authorities, and how to react if attacked, required snap decision making. There was no time for disagreement or debate in these cases and conflicting voices would have made it impossible to undertake the most essential tasks.\n...\nA captain who wielded unquestioned authority in certain decisions was critical for success. But what was to prevent him from turning his power against his crew for personal benefit in the same manner predatory merchant captains did?\nHowever, they had another officer to check-and-balance the captain's power:\nThe primary “other officer” pirates constituted for this purpose was the quartermaster. The way this office worked is straightforward. Captains retained absolute authority in times of battle, enabling pirates to realize the benefits of autocratic control required for success in conflict. However, pirate crews transferred power to allocate provisions, select and distribute loot (there was rarely room aboard pirate ships to take all they seized from a prize), adjudicate crew member conflicts, and administer discipline to the quartermaster, whom they democratically elected.\nBoth the captain and quartermaster were elected positions and subject to recall. Leeson quotes James Madison to emphasize the importance of checks-and-balances:\nIn framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.”\nIn addition to this division of power, pirates also had codified articles spelling out the rules their crew would have to follow. Because the law wasn't on their side, pirates had no outside force they could rely on to maintain order on board. Therefore, it was important that the majority (they took captives, of course, but would not want them to out-number the crew) were there voluntarily and consented to some basic rules. Similar logic influenced pirates' divergence from the slavery of their day:\nPirates took slaves, held slaves, and sold slaves. On the other hand, some pirates displayed significantly more tolerant behavior toward blacks. Upward of a quarter of the average pirate crew may have been black. Many of these sailors were former slaves and at least some of them were treated on equal terms with white sailors in the pirate crews they sailed with. They had equal voting rights in the pirates’ democracy and likely received an equal share of the pirates’ plunder.\nOne of the key themes of Invisible Hook is that pirates (in general) were neither blood-thirsty sadists nor idealistic egalitarians, but were responding relatively rationally to the realities of their situation. For example, they had more free Africans on their crews than merchant ships did; according to the author's interpretation, this was not because they were persuaded by the appeals of abolitionists but because having people on their ships who didn't want to be there carried a risk and unlike on merchant ships the proceeds of slave labour would have been dispersed among the entire crew instead of to a single owner. Similarly, pirates had to limit their use of conscription.\nSomething that stands out to me is how short the golden age of piracy was—basically a single life-time—and how the number of sailors involved was not actually that great. In the waning decade of the period, around 400 people were executed as pirates (out of perhaps a couple thousand who were involved so the majority either weren't caught or got away with lesser penalties):\nbetween 1716 and 1726 some four hundred pirates were hanged—an average of forty sea dogs per year. Eighty-two of these executions came in 1723 alone, a strong indication government’s bolstered antipiracy efforts, in full swing by the early 1720s, were having the desired effect.\nFor a relatively small group, pirates still loom large in the imagination. And some of the key structures they used to promote order and cooperation in their ship-board societies (e.g. division of power) are more common now than they were in their own day.\nSea Wolves was a pretty quick read on the history of Vikings—mainly on the \"sea kings\" who went off raiding (or trading or exploring), sometimes over remarkable distances, and less on the societies that spawned them. In contrast to the book that I reviewed in my previous post, this book was a pretty linear (divided by region) narrative.\nAs a narrative, Sea Wolves tends to focus on some prominent men and women in history, both Vikings and people that fought against them. I got the impression that good leadership was very important, since a kingdom might suffer repeated raids from a Viking sea king then in the next generation the tables would turn. Here are some of the people who stood out the most:\nSea Wolves is divided into four sections: Raiders, Explorers, Traders, and Homelands. The first section is about the Danish and Norwegian Vikings who raided along the Frankish coast and the British Isles. Prior to their raids, the 8th century had peace and stability (thus monasteries being filled with treasures from donors and pilgrims). Raiding evolved into obtaining territory: in Normandy, northern England, and Ireland (York and Dublin were actually important Viking cities at one time). As warlords turned into kings in Scandinavia, some norse found the government too restrictive and set out for fresh territory, discovering and settling Iceland and Greenland and even briefly trying to establish a settlement in North America. Vikings from Sweden went the opposite direction, trading—and taking slaves—up and down the rivers of western Russia. They became a ruling caste of Kievan Rus. The Volga took them to the Caspian Sea and the Dniepr took them to the Black Sea and Constantinople, which they attacked a few times (see here) and ultimately got hired on as an elite mercenary corps (the Varangian Guard). The final section is about the transition of the Viking homelands from places where ambitious men could go off raiding and become sea-kings to more centralized kingdoms (King Cnut, for example, was treated practically as an equal to the Holy Roman Emperor).\nLars Brownworth discusses a few factors for why the Vikings were able to go so far and have such an impact from a small and remote population base. Their ships, swords, and organization all gave them an edge:\nWhat made the great Viking raids possible was a revolution in shipbuilding at the end of the eighth century. The earliest Viking vessels were copied from Roman or Celtic designs and powered by oars instead of the usual paddles. Like all ships of the time they were slow and prone to capsizing in rough seas, appropriate for short trips that hugged the shore. Sometime in the eighth century, however, the Vikings invented the keel. This simple addition is among the greatest of nautical breakthroughs. Not only did it stabilize the ship, making it ocean-worthy, but it provided a base to anchor the mast. A massive sail, some as large as eight hundred square feet, could now be added as the major source of propulsion. The impact was immediate and stunning.\nViking longships lacked the keels of the larger ocean-crossing ships, and their relatively shallow drafts allowed them to be beached virtually anywhere instead of just the deep-water ports required by other vessels. This made it possible for a longship to navigate up rivers, and some were light enough to be carried between river systems.\nThe advantage in speed (compared to defending armies travelling by road) was remarkable:\n[A] fleet in Scandinavia could cover the nine hundred miles to the mouth of the Seine in three weeks, an average of over forty miles per day. Under oar they were nearly as fast.\nThe medieval armies they faced, assuming they had access to a good Roman roads, could only average between twelve and fifteen miles per day. Even elite cavalry forces pushing hard could only manage twenty.\nViking swords were also state-of-the-art:\nThe one exception to this general inferiority [of equipment] was Viking swords. The original design was probably copied from an eighth century Frankish source, a blacksmith named Ulfberht whose name soon became a brand. The Vikings quickly learned to manufacture the blades themselves, and weapons bearing the inscription Ulfberht have been found all over Scandinavia. They were typically double edged, with a rounded point, made of multiple bars of iron twisted together. This pattern welding created a relatively strong and lightweight blade that could be reforged if broken. They were clearly among a warrior's most prized possessions and were passed down as heirlooms and given names\nAnother advantage was their flexible organization:\nAside from their swords, the Vikings’ main advantages lay in their sophisticated intelligence gathering and their terrifying adaptability. They had advance warning of most Frankish military maneuvers, and could respond quickly to take advantage of political changes. Most formidable of all, was their malleability. ‘Brotherhoods’ of dozens or even hundreds could combine into a larger army, and then re-dissolve into groups at will.\n(This certainly has parallels with pirate organization discussed above; I'm also reminded of some of the discussion of organizational effectiveness in a book on monastic orders I read a couple of years ago).\nCountering these advantages took a lot of effort on the part of Vikings' targets. Here are some reforms that Alfred the Great made to resist them more effectively:\nThe Vikings’ mobility had been the key to their success, so Alfred took it away. Towns, bridges, and roads were fortified, and strongholds were built throughout Wessex to deny roving bands any sanctuary. Within fifteen years, the kingdom was bristling with fortresses allowing the English to strike at any future raid from numerous points. Next, Alfred reorganized the army, training a professional, permanent force supported by taxes, to replace the unreliable peasant levies. He even attempted to challenge the Viking monopoly of sea power by beginning work on a fleet, although the results proved disappointing. To stabilize things internally, he also reformed the currency.\nHe also insisted on literacy for his commanders so that they could receive written orders.\nThe Viking era lasted for a few centuries, but it re-shaped the map of Europe:\nIt was the Vikings who exposed the sprawling empire of Charlemagne, revealing fundamental flaws in the organization of that would-be-Roman Empire. As it broke apart under the hammer blows of the Vikings, the survivors were forced to create smaller, more efficient states. Out of the ashes of the Viking assault rose the four great medieval powers of Western Europe: France, England, The Holy Roman Empire, and the kingdom of Sicily. All four of these were direct products of the Viking age, and three of them were founded or consolidated by Viking descendants.\nAt the same time, Viking traders in the east were establishing the market towns and trade routes with Byzantium that would bring Roman institutions far beyond the borders of the ancient Roman empire. The centralized states that they founded would eventually develop into what is today the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.\n(Apparently \"town names that end with -bec in France or -by in England\" were named by Vikings).\nIn the Norman invasion of England in 1066, all sides were led by people of Viking descent. Harold Godwinson (whose mother was Danish) defeated Harald Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge but then was defeated himself by a Norman duke descended from Rollo.\nDuring the Viking era, the region gradually converted from paganism to Christianity. Sea Wolves discusses the conversion of several rulers. Interestingly, most of the conversions in the book (at least on the part of the rulers) were not at the point of a sword but to seal marriage, trade, or political alliances. Vladimir (of Kievan Rus) was a typical example:\nThe conclusion to which Vladimir came – to convert to Christianity – was the realization that he could accomplish far more as an ally of Constantinople than as a Viking sea-king. With that step, he spiritually and culturally cut the ties with his Viking heritage.\nLars Brownworth surmises that contact with Byzantium may have motivated Vladimir (and a similar story could apply for Danish and Norwegian rulers in contact with the Holy Roman Empire) to also have a society with only a single God—and only a single king. Whatever the motivation, however, there were numerous positive effects:\nA cynical observer, and there were many of them in Vladimir's time, would say that his conversion was purely a political move, but, strange as it may seem, he appears to have been genuinely changed. The man who had raped his own sister-in-law now organized daily food drives for the ill and destitute. He laid out his own table for the sick, and when told that some were too ailing to make it, he arranged for wagons of bread, fish, vegetables, and mead to be taken to them. He dismissed his non-Byzantine wives and his small army of concubines, and ironically – considering the amount of blood that he had spilled – abolished the death penalty. Schools were founded in several cities, and a part of each year's tax revenue was set aside for alms.\nOne of the biggest changes was the cessation of the Viking slave trade:\nSlavs, who were no longer seen as targets to be raided, but as Christian subjects to be protected.\nOn the subject of Vikings, here is a game and a study about them that I came across recently.\nThe chapters that I read in Legal Systems Very Different from Ours complement the two books reviewed above. They concern legal and economic structures among Icelandic society and among pirates.\nFriedman describes how Icelandic criminal law was similar to current tort law:\nIn saga-period Iceland a thousand years ago, if you killed someone his relatives sued you. Studying that system was what first got me interested in the broader subject of this book.\nLike Sea Wolves, Friedman's chapter on Iceland describes how it was settled by people who found living under a king too stifling:\nIn the latter half of the ninth century, King Harald Fairhair unified Norway under his rule. A substantial number of the inhabitants, unhappy with the change, left; many went either directly to Iceland, which had been discovered by the Norse a few years earlier, or indirectly via Norse colonies in England, Ireland, Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Shetland Islands. The political system they developed there was based on Norwegian traditions with one important innovation–there was no king. The relationship between the Icelandic godi and his thingmen (thingmenn) was contractual but not territorial. The godi had no claim to the thingman's land and the thingman was free to transfer his allegiance.\nIcelanders were very independent; the legal system they used didn't come with much bureaucracy.\nPenalties imposed by Icelandic courts were either outlawry or wergeld (payment for taking a life):\nThe function of the courts was to deliver verdicts on cases brought to them. That done, the court was finished. For serious offenses, conviction meant full outlawry. The outlaw’s property was confiscated, part going as a damage payment to the victim or his heirs, part to support the outlaw’s dependents. If more was available, ... . It was legal to kill an outlaw, illegal to feed him, shelter him, or help him to leave Iceland. For somewhat less serious offenses, conviction meant lesser outlawry. A lesser outlaw had the right to leave Iceland and could return in three years. For still less serious offenses the punishment was a fine. ...\nProsecution was up to the victim or his survivors. If they and the offender agreed on a settlement, the matter was settled. Most cases in the sagas were settled out of court, usually for money damages, sometimes for lesser outlawry or greater outlawry with permission to leave Iceland. Many were settled by arbitration, including the two most serious conflicts that arose prior to the final period of breakdown in the thirteenth century. Calculations by two different scholars suggest that only about a tenth of cases went to a final judgment by the court.\nWhere a clash resulted in deaths on both sides they were usually set off against each other, sometimes weighted by how important the man killed was, with the excess paid in wergeld or outlawries. In some cases part of the payment for killing one man was the cancellation of the outlawry imposed on another in a previous conflict.\nFriedman includes a table that shows wergeld owed for crimes against people at different levels of society, calculated in terms of wages and cloth production.\nHe seems to think the system was well-balanced at first, until power got concentrated in too-few hands:\nOne cause of the breakdown of the Icelandic system seems to have been increased concentration of wealth and hence power. By the Sturlung period there were many areas where all or most of the godord were held by one family, reducing or eliminating the ability of the individual thingman to choose his godi and creating a de facto, if imperfect, form of territorial sovereignty.\nIn the chapter on pirates, I found Friedman covered a lot of the same concepts in a much more concise manner than The Invisible Hook did (and since his chapter is available for free, I'd recommend reading it if the topic interests you). At least one of his articles is cited in that book, so he may have even inspired some of the ideas it contains. He frames the same dilemma that pirates would face in maintaining order on board:\nSuccessful piracy required the cooperation of a sizeable pirate crew. The average Caribbean pirate ship was crewed by 80 men, and the largest crews consisted of several hundred. This raises the question of how pirates, who, as criminals, could not rely on government to provide their crews law and order and had no compunction about murdering and stealing for private gain, managed to cooperate with one another to engage in piracy.\nPirate crews were much larger than merchant crews for the same size vessel (giving them an advantage in a fight, but making any on-board conflict more of a risk).\nLike Leeson, Friedman discusses pirate articles and the roles of captain and quartermaster, along with pirates cultivating a reputation for brutality to discourage resistance and pretending to be conscripted when they'd actually joined voluntarily. So he covers much of the same ground (but obviously doesn't have space to expand on things as much).\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a review of Water on Sand: Environmental Histories of the Middle East and North Africa. The chapters have different authors and mostly stand on their own; the editor of the whole volume is Alan Mikhail.\nOne of the things I've read a fair bit about (although never formally studied) is the history of irrigation and hydraulic engineering. I've also read and written about water and other environmental issues quite a bit on my blog. So the title of this book caught my attention. Water on Sand didn't have as much on water resources as I expected from the title, but it was interesting and I learned a lot from it. The range of authors it included made it a nice sample of perspectives on environmental history in general.\nBecause each chapter in Water on Sand covers a different topic, discussing all of them in this review would take way too long. Instead, I'm going to briefly outline the book then discuss a few sections I found most interesting.\nThe introduction of Water on Sand spends some time explaining what environmental history is. This field considers how human history has been shaped by environmental factors and also how the environment has been influenced by human action throughout history:\nBy contrast, a dialectical understanding of humans and environments recognizes, in William Cronon’s well-known formulation, that “environment may initially shape the range of choices available to a people at a given moment, but then culture reshapes environment in responding to those choices. The reshaped environment presents a new set of possibilities for cultural reproduction, thus setting up a new cycle of mutual determination.\nThe introduction also mentions Wittfogel's \"hydraulic hypothesis\", which I've written about before:\nOne of the best-known historiographical interventions of the MENA in environmental history revolves around Karl A. Wittfogel’s thesis of Oriental despotism, which states that highly complex and coordinated systems of irrigation lead to authoritarian forms of government because only a central power can oversee and coordinate such a diffuse network of actors, interests, and limited resources. Several of his examples of the emergence of such despotic forms of authoritarian government come from the Middle East—Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley. However, a full examination of the documentary record shows that it was the very people Wittfogel claims were exploited by sultans, emperors, and kings who were actually in control of the day-to-day functioning and maintenance of the large-scale irrigation networks that are so crucial to his argument.\nThe book has 11 chapters that deal with very diverse topics (everything from Ottoman fisheries to national parks in French North Africa). In brief, here is what each chapter is about:\nOne of the things I appreciated was that a lot of these chapters (each author had their own style, so I can't completely generalize) brought in a lot of data. They took an analytical approach rather than a narrative one. Primary documents are often the source for this data. For example, chapter 4 has tables listing varieties of fish that were commercially harvested in Istanbul in different centuries, gleaned from travelogues and the like.\nThe first sections I want to discuss in more detail are chapters 2 and 6. They deal with the importance of pastoralism in the environmental history of the MENA region. Many areas in this region do not receive enough rainfall to grow crops for human consumption, but they will grow enough grass to support livestock. This encourages a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle of moving herds between grazing areas. Having small areas (e.g. river valleys) where crops could be grown surrounded by areas only suitable for grazing greatly influenced settlement patterns in the Middle East (described in Chapter 1):\nThe MENA had no such broad [agricultural/settlement] expanses. It instead had small zones of continual settlement, such as western Anatolia or the river valleys, together making up an archipelago. The settlement pattern resembles that of Polynesia more than that of China or India, with larger and smaller “islands” of habitation existing where enough water could be found.\nThis fragmented pattern maximized the interaction between pastoralists and farmers, between tribal confederations and agrarian states.\nIn Chapter 2, Water on Sand explains that the abundance of land available for grazing gave animal power a low opportunity cost compared to other parts of the world. In Europe, by contrast, land used to raise animals could have otherwise been used to grow food for people. This gave Europeans an incentive to replace animal power with wind- or water-power, leading to a technological class (Miller is a common surname in many European languages but much less so in Arabic, according to a table in Chapter 2) that was well-suited to take advantage of coal power during the Industrial Revolution. Here are some excerpts from Chapter 2 that develop this theme:\nIn political terms, the MENA’s grass and animals were an important source of military power, wielded sometimes by pastoralist tribes, but sometimes by agrarian empires employing tribesmen as fighters. But when coal became king, the MENA’s economic and political position plummeted vis-à-vis other parts of the world.\nThus no other broad region matches the extensive foraging resources of the arid zone or supports such robust traditions of dispersed pastoral nomadism devoted to extracting animal sustenance from almost every seemingly desolate square mile.\nGiven the near-zero cost of animal power, the peoples of North Africa, the Middle East, and Inner Asia were no more capable of seizing the opportunities presented by Europe’s ever more sophisticated utilization of water- and windpower than we are today, in the face of cheap oil, of investing vast sums on the alternative energy sources that we will one day so greatly need.\nChapter 6 also makes much of the \"interface between steppe and sown\". It was a recurring pattern on the margins of Central Asia for nomads to take over established polities:\nIn time, pastoralists crossed from deserts to the urban spaces of river valleys to conquer cities and establish new dynasties, only to burn out and be conquered by city life in turn.\nChapter 6 is specifically about Turkmen pastoralists, who lived in the Qara Qum desert formed when a river changed course:\naround the year 1576, the Oxus River changed channels, swerving toward the Aral Sea and turning the lands between its former bed and the Caspian Sea into a waterless desert.\nAttracted by the fine horses of the Turkmen, the East India company sent a man named Mir Izzat Ullah on a journey through Central Asia (Delhi – Kashmir and Ladakh – Kashgar – Khoqand – Samarqand – Bukhara – Balkh – Bamiyan – Kabul, taking 21 months); Chapter 6 is mainly based on the record of his journey:\nThe peregrinations of Mir Izzat Ullah took him through a borderland space where contacts and encounters between empires and steppe peoples were commensurate and symmetrical. His journeys betray the strength and resilience of a pastoral world on empire’s edge. Even more, Mir Izzat Ullah’s journeys demonstrate the interaction and encounter between different “regimes of circulation,” between the pastoral societies of the Eurasian Steppe and a merchant traveler from the imperial setting of the East India Company.\nThe relationship between pastoralist communities and empires was not one-dimensional. Turkmen raided Marv and Mashhad, but they also had a resource that empires coveted: excellent horses:\nThe steppe landscape could destabilize, even conquer, surrounding imperial regimes, just as it could supply empires with much sought-after pastoral resources. As Turkmen horses gained fame and became coveted commodities, early modern Eurasian empires set out to find Central Eurasian breeds and hence harness the pastoral resources of the steppes.\nThe other section I wanted to focus on in this review was Chapter 7, about national parks in North Africa and how one of their uses was to attempt to control nomadic populations. The French colonists had a vision that North Africa used to be lushly forested (inspired by accounts from Roman times) and assumed that over-grazing was the reason that that was no longer the case. So they created national parks in Algeria (and elsewhere in their North African colonies) to restrict extant forests from pastoralists' use:\nWhile far from accurate, this French colonial environmental history served, beginning in 1830s Algeria, to undermine the lifeways of the indigenous populations as it justified—in the name of environmental protection—the expropriation of their land and property, the transfer of tribal forests to the French state, and the sedentarization of nomads.\nWhat the French never understood during the colonial period was that traditional North African land-use practices were largely ecologically appropriate and thus “sustainable” for the population levels of the early to mid-nineteenth century. Given the ecology of the region, in which a majority of plants were highly adapted to drought, fire, and grazing, regenerating pastures and clearing fields of weeds and pests with fire was well suited to the environment.\n(Another book I've read discusses the indigenous use of fire for landscape management and a documentary I've watched argues that grazing can be beneficial for grasslands).\nDesignation of areas as national parks (or other protected status) continues to be a method of trying to restrict the movements of herders:\nThe MENA is home to more pastoralists than almost anywhere else in the world. To enclose more of their productive arid grazing lands in the name of biodiversity or environmental protection will lead almost certainly to further social injustice and likely to greater ecological harm.\nChapter 7 also makes the point that a vision of nature devoid of people is not actually natural:\nWestern visions of the natural world that are increasingly being revealed to be social constructions largely divorced from ecological, social, and historical realities.\nThis is worth remembering even with respect to national parks in Western countries. Close to home, for example, a number of families had their homes expropriated when Kouchibouguac National Park was formed in 1969. With calls to protect huge additional areas in Canada it is worth being vigilant so these protections aren't used to restrict rural (here it would be things like fisheries and forestry rather than herding) ways of life.\nChapter 10 touches on similar themes, describing how Saudi Arabia has promoted the settlement of nomadic tribes:\nPromoting sedentarization and using settlements as instruments to overcome politically threatening raiding practices reflected a new strategic thinking on the part of Saudi leaders.\nTo wrap up this post, there were some quotes and factoids from Water On Sand that didn't fit neatly in the review above but I still wanted to share:\n[The] average pharaoh, emir, or sultan had less energy at his command than has a modern bulldozer operator.\nAccording to one calculation, before fossil fuels a European or Chinese city needed wood from an expanse of forest 50–200 times its own area.\nthe politics of using national development schemes such as dams as an opportunity to relocate ethnic groups that the state has been trying to control for the past century—such as the Kurds—present clear comparisons to the High Dam case.\nThere is a long history of water manipulation and agricultural development projects around the world that have failed to meet their ambitious goals.\nThis is an Arabic environmental magazine that was mentioned in Water on Sand.\nA USAID study in Egypt found that if water had to be lifted more than 20 m, energy costs made desert land reclamation non-feasible.\nPermalink",

    "content": "With this post, I've come to the end of my series going through the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce Tate. It was a good experience and I feel like I learned quite a bit (but have a lot more to learn—this really only scratched the surface of working with these languages).\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nHaskell is the final language in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. It is a language that takes a purist approach to the functional paradigm and the author considers it the most difficult one in the book to learn. Having it at the end of the book was a good choice since it has a lot of similar features to the functional languages covered earlier (especially Erlang and Clojure). Here are some of Bruce Tate's comments about Haskell:\nHaskell supports a wide variety of functional capabilities including list comprehensions, lazy computing strategies, partially applied functions, and currying. In fact, by default, Haskell functions process one parameter at a time, using currying to support multiple arguments.\nHe also gives this explanation of functions in Haskell:\nThe centerpiece of the whole Haskell programming paradigm is the function. Since Haskell has strong, static typing, you'll specify each function in two parts: an optional type specification and the implementation.\nHere are my notes on Haskell:\nHere are some examples that should help clarify some of these features in Haskell:\n(Prelude> is the prompt in the interpreter when no modules are loaded.)\nThis example shows mapping an anonymous function (squaring each element) and then a section (multiplying by two) to a list. Next a function called prod is defined that multiplies two numbers together. After using it to calculate 3 x 4, it is mapped (as a \"section\" with one input filled in) onto a list. Then a new function is defined based on partial application of the first function.\nThe next example is a .hs file that defines some functions:\nThe first function tests whether a number is a denominator of another. It takes a tuple of two integers as an input and returns True or False. The next function calculates the factors of a number using a \"list comprehension\"; the denom test function is used as a filter. To test if an integer is prime (using the approach from this answer), the third function checks whether a number has only two factors (i.e. one and itself). The last two functions calculate the common factors of two integers (from another list comprehension; note that the range in the list generator should only go to the maximum of x or y rather than their sum but I didn't know the function for that) and their greatest common factor (as the last element in a list of common factors). Note that I didn't declare type on all of the methods (at the time I couldn't figure out how to declare the type when the result is in a list; now I think it should be Integer -> [Integer] for the factors function, but I haven't tested that) but Haskell is able to infer it.\nTo continue this example, this shows loading these functions and applying them:\nThe final line applies filter and the is_prime test function to a list/range of numbers from 1 to 100.\nHaskell is easy to Google for, so the only link I'll share is this site where you can try it online.\nI've now come to the end of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. It was a good experience. Obviously a week wasn't enough time to become proficient with any of the languages covered, but it was enough to get my feet wet. Also, I feel that seeing some key concepts (e.g. types, object-oriented vs. functional paradigms, recursion, common tools—like filtering and mapping—for dealing with lists, and what concurrency is even if I didn't go too far into it) repeated in multiple languages helped me understand some new things about programming. I liked learning new techniques for problem solving like list comprehensions and pattern-matching/destructuring in some of the functional languages.\nOver seven-ish weeks (not counting an intermission), I'd guess I put at least 40 hours into Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. That makes it roughly equivalent to the time that would be spent in lectures in a 1 semester undergraduate course. While working full time it can be hard to find this kind of time, but it is encouraging to know that 40 hours focusing on something is enough to make noticeable progress in your skills. I'd recommend this book to others that want to improve their programming know-how. It's probably not ideal for an absolute beginner but if you have a language or two that you're half-way comfortable in you should be able to get something out of it. And if your programming background is a lot stronger than mine, I still think you could find something interesting in this book; I think it works on multiple levels. For example, I skimmed/skipped over a lot of the subsections on concurrency (except in Io), because that topic is more advanced than my skill level (and more relevant for real-time applications, which aren't really my area of interest), but for someone else seeing how different languages approach concurrency might be a highlight of the book.\nI'm coming from a perspective where any programming I do is small-scale scripting for my personal use, so I find that setting up classes (in object-oriented languages) and strong, explicit typing add too much overhead. Keeping that perspective in mind, here are some of my feelings on the languages covered in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks:\nWell, this concludes the longest series I've done to date on this blog. While I've been going through it, I've also finished reading some books, so for my next posts I'm planning to write some reviews.\nPermalink",

The programming language\ncovered in this week's chapter is Clojure, a dialect of Lisp\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/",
    "content": "After the past two posts on different topics, I'm returning to my series on Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce Tate. The programming language covered in this week's chapter is Clojure, a dialect of Lisp.\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nLanguages such as Clojure that are in the Lisp family have a sort of mystique due to their sparse syntax and proliferation of parentheses. I had a lot of fun starting to get the hang of it in this week's chapter. Here is how Bruce Tate describes this language:\nClojure is a functional language on the [Java virtual machine]. Like Scala and Erlang, this Lisp dialect is a functional language but not a pure functional language. It allows limited side effects. Unlike other Lisp dialects, Clojure adds a little syntax, preferring braces for maps and brackets for vectors. You can use commas for whitespace and omit parentheses in some places.\nThe code is dense but expressive. That's an ideal combination.\nThere are some other quotes (about lists, prefix notation, and macros) from Seven Languages in Seven Weeks that I'd like to share before getting into my own notes:\nLisp is a language of lists. A function call uses the first list element as the function and the rest as the arguments.\nLisp uses its own data structures to express code.\n[Prefix notation] requires a developer to comprehend code from the inside out, rather than outside in.\nMacro expansion is perhaps the most powerful feature of Lisp, and few languages can do it. The secret sauce is the expression of data as code, not just a string.\nI'll expand on these concepts in my notes and examples below.\nTwo key ideas about Clojure are that:\nThere is some simplification here, but it gives a general outline of the language's structure.\nHere are my notes on Clojure (in addition to the book, these come from the first reference link near the end of this post):\nComments start with a ;\nLists go in parentheses (so everything is encompassed by parentheses) with items separated by whitespace: (item0 item1 ...). Commas can be added for clarity since they are treated as whitespace. Lists/functions can also be broken over multiple lines to improve readability.\nThe initial item in a list is assumed to be a function and the remaining items its arguments. Use the list function or precede the open parenthesis with a single quote (i.e. '() to make a literal list. eval will execute a literal list as a function.\n= is used to test for equality. Create a variable with (def variablename value). let can also be used for binding values to variables (with destructuring/pattern matching) but only within a temporary context (until the parentheses around the let are closed.\nstr turns its arguments into a string. Strings are surrounded by double-quotes (\"). A letter preceded by a backslash acts as a single character, but within strings they act as escape sequences (e.g. \\n is the character n, but \"\\n\" is a newline). println prints a line.\nThe use of the first item in a list as the function even applies to math. That is, Clojure uses prefix/Polish notation instead of the more familiar infix notation. -> and ->> (they work slightly differently, but I won't go into detail here) can be used to change the order for convenience/readability, however.\nTo add to lists (or vectors), the functions cons, conj, concat can be used depending on the behaviour you want.\nfirst, rest, last, etc. can be used to get elements from a specified position in a list or vector.\nLists, vectors, maps, and sets are the main data structures. Collectively, they are known as collections and sequences (see here for a discussion of the differences between these terms) It is customary to use lists for code and vectors for data. But here is a key point about Lisp dialects: Code is data. I've already mentioned that lists are assumed to be functions. Vectors, maps, and sets can also act as functions. They are also items (even if the only item) in a list, since the line they are on will need to be enclosed by parentheses like anything else. Hopefully the next few points will clarify these concepts:\nVectors go in square brackets. A vector used as a function takes an index (0 is the first element) as an argument and returns the element at that index.\nMaps go in curly braces and comprise key-value pairs. Keywords begin with :. A map can be used as a function with a key as the argument (it also works to use the key as the function and the map as the argument) to return the associated value. merge (or merge-with to instruct how to deal with duplicate keys) combines two maps, assoc adds a new key-value pair, and dissoc drops a key from a map.\nSets go in curly braces preceded by a hash (i.e. #{ ... }). When used as a function, they test whether their argument is a member of that set. A set can be created from a list or vector by calling the set function on it; this function reduces the list/vector to unique entries. Functions that apply to sets include clojure.set/union, clojure.set/intersection, clojure.set/difference—unlike most of the other functions I'm discussing here, these are not part of the core module.\nPredicates are tests that return a boolean true/false result. Such functions are supposed to end with a question mark (e.g. odd?, even?). They can be used with functions such as filter, some, every?.\nmap applies a function to each element in a list or vector. reduce shrinks a list or vector to a single result by applying the specified operation between each element (e.g. reduce + adds up all of the elements).\n\"Destructuring\" is a useful feature in Clojure. It involves matching the arguments to a function or a let statement to an expected order (using _ to hold a position whose contents don't matter), enclosed in square brackets. It can also be used to match the value that corresponds to a certain key in a map.\nFunctions can be defined by (defn functionname [parameters] statement). If desired, documentation for the function can be added as a string between the function name and parameters; it can be retrieved by calling doc on the function (which can also be called on built-in functions). fn creates an anonymous function (these can be used in the context of map or filter, for example). Anonymous functions can be defined more succinctly by preceding a list with a hash (i.e. #(...)) and using % as a stand-in for the items passed to the function.\nOne of the really useful properties of Clojure is that sequences are evaluated lazily (i.e. each element is only calculated when it is needed). This means that infinite sequences can be set up without problems. range, repeat, cycle, iterate can create infinite (or finite, depending on how many arguments they are given) sequences. iterate, for example, is given a function and initial value. When working with infinite sequences, (take n) selects the first n items, (drop n) drops the first n items, and (nth sequence n) returns only item n.\nMacros are another powerful—but difficult—feature of Clojure. Macros basically write customized lists from the input they're given. Because lists are functions, this allows macros to work as meta-functions. Words or symbols that would normally have an effect need to be quoted (i.e. preceded by a single quote) so that they will appear literally when the new list is returned by the macro. Use defmacro to define a macro and macroexpand to show what a macro will return given certain inputs (this is useful, since it can be complicated to make sure everything is quoted at the right level and expands with the proper configuration of parentheses).\nHere are some examples of Clojure code. Compared to some of the other languages in the book, a lot of them are pretty short because the language is so concise.\nI liked this example with for from Seven Languages in Seven Weeks because it demonstrates filtering using :when:\nObserve that every line is enclosed in parentheses, the first item in each set of parentheses is a function, and the evaluation starts inside the deepest nested layer (e.g. the :when filter finds values of x equal to \"green\" then applies a logical not).\nHere is a compact example of calculating the sum of squares of a vector using an anonymous function (#(* % %)), which multiplies each element (%) passed to it by itself, then adding up the squared numbers with reduce +:\nMy next example uses lazy evaluation of infinite sequences. It calculates the results of the well-known problem for how far a stack of dominoes can be made to hang over an edge (the answer is half of the sum of the harmonic series, the sequence of fractions where the denominator increases by 1 each time):\nFirst, I define a function for taking the reciprocal. On the next lines, starting from the inside, I use iterate on the inc function (which increments a value by 1 each time) to make an infinite sequence of integers. Next, I use map and the harmonic function I defined to move each element to the denominator. With take and reduce I add up the first 5 or 8 elements. Finally, I multiply the result by half. The Wikipedia article on this problem has results for numbers up to 30 in a table and my answers for 5 and 8 check out. Observe that Clojure will actually do calculations with fractions—this is a nice feature that avoids losing precision.\nMy final example is a simple macro that allows calculations to be written in Reverse Polish notation, the opposite order from how Clojure normally works:\nThe macro definition relies on destructuring. It looks for an argument containing 3 entries, then writes a list with the third one (c) in the first position. When the macro is expanded, it looks like a normal Clojure calculation, so running the macro gives the correct result.\nFinally, here are some links and references about Clojure:\nThe final language in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks is Haskell. I plan to cover that chapter in my next post, along with some concluding thoughts.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I intended to have this post written shortly after Easter, but April has been a really busy month so far (and looks to continue as such) so I didn't get to it until now. Next post, I plan to return to my series on Seven Languages in Seven Weeks.\nRecently I re-read a book about Paul by John Pollock, called The Apostle. I also took a free course on Udemy by N.T. Wright about one of Paul's letters (Philemon). In this post I wanted to share my notes and the things I learned from them.\nThe Apostle is written as a biography of Paul, expanding on what is written in the book of Acts with what can be inferred from the Epistles, historical sources, and archaeology. Where nothing else is available, Pollock fills in the gaps with reasoned speculation. It is helpful for understanding the context and audience each epistle was written for. As I'll discuss below, I also appreciated getting a better sense of the cities and regions of the eastern Mediterranean in the first century.\nTo start with, here is a brief summary of Paul's life from my notes from The Apostle:\nIn reading The Apostle, I learned about some historical figures that intersected with Paul's life:\nAn insight that I appreciated from the book is that one of Paul's sermons effectively finishes the speech Stephen was making at his trial.\nI also liked this passage on the legacy of Paul's speech on Mars Hill:\nAthens had rejected him. He could not know that his speech would go down to posterity beside the Funeral Oration of Pericles and the Philippics of Demosthenes as one of the great speeches of Athens. He could not know that whole books would be written about it or that in a few hundred years the Parthenon would become a Christian church; and the nineteen centuries on, when Greece after long suppression became once more a sovereign state, the national flag which flies beside the ruins of the Parthenon would be lowered to half-mast each Good Friday, and raised on Easter Day in honor of Christ's Resurrection. (p. 116)\nFrom reading The Apostle I got a better sense of the places Paul travelled to—and he did a ton of travelling:\nThus, in his late forties, an age when men settle to comforts and seek a firm base, Paul began his roughest travels. The task was immense. Against him stood the contemporary climate of thought, the great philosophies, the leading religions of the world. His ally was the age-old, unending human search for truth and security. (p. 54)\nNo man in previous history had traveled so far or suffered so much to bring men truth; he could not stay still or silent while others remained ignorant of the Way, the Truth and the Life. (p. 113)\nFor example, Paul travelled between Antioch in Syria and Pisidian Antioch at least a couple of times. At least one of those journeys seems to have been overland (other times he would have gone part of the way by ship*), probably on foot. Here is the distance on Google Maps:\n*Some of the descriptions of travelling by ship reminded me of the shipwrecks that Dr. Ballard investigated around Rhodes in Alien Deep.\nThe first major mountain pass on this journey is the Cilician Gates. The city of Konya was known as Iconium in antiquity.\nFor a more artistic perspective, here's a subway-style map of Roman roads in the second century A.D. (I cropped it to the Eastern Mediterranean region where Paul spent most or all of his life from the original here. All credit goes to the cartographer, Sasha Trubetskoy). Paul would have travelled on many of these roads.\nOut of the places Paul went, Galatia was fairly rural (towns like Lystra and Derbe were small) and the Macedonian cities (Philippi and Thessalonica) were also small. Athens and Corinth were big cities, though, and Ephesus was an important regional hub. Adding to these notes about the communities he visited, here are some excerpts from The Apostle where John Pollock describes the context of some of the epistles:\nRomans:\nIn contrast with previous letters, he is not obliged to combat aberrations; or to rebut criticisms except once, when he snubs slanderers who twist his words to \"sin away, to give God's forgiveness more opportunity!\" Only once, too, does his tendency to justify himself break through...\nInstead there is a calmness, a magisterial confidence in this letter to Rome, the longest he ever wrote, which distinguishes it from those to Galatia and Corinth. It contains some of his profoundest, most difficult writing and much of his most beautiful. ... it has also been one of the world's decisive books. It formed the seedbed of Augustine's faith and Luther's Reformation. It was reading Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans that caused John Wesley's heart to feel \"strangely warmed... \" (p. 174)\nColossians and Ephesians:\nColossians and the other letter, known as Ephesians, emerged similar in content yet distinctive in style. Thoughts much in Paul's mind are found in both, sometimes in identical phrases so that it is even possible he composed the letters together, dictating part of one, then part of the other. To Colossae, with a particular church in mind, he can include personal messages while Ephesians is more formal yet gives intimate autobiographical comments, especially when his mind is with those who have never seen him. (p. 224)\nPhilemon:\nBy implication the letter to Philemon displays Paul's total rejection of slavery as a state compatible with the gospel in a Christian society. Paul was no Spartacus calling slaves to revolt: a sudden end of slavery would reduce the Roman Empire to chaos and he was realist enough to recognize that to agitate for abolition in his lifetime would be senseless, merely provoking the crushing of Christians as a menace to law and order. But he had consistently taught that \"In Christ there is neither slave nor free,\" since all are equal in the sight of their Master, Christ. Both Ephesians and Colossians (Onesimus and Philemon surely being much in mind as he wrote) emphasize the new relationship between slave and free in which each must look on the other as a brother. (p. 227)\nThe book of Philemon was the subject of the N.T. Wright course I took on Udemy. The course is free and only an hour long, so rather than try to summarize it here, I'll just encourage you to watch it if interested. In the course, professor Wright compares Paul's letter to Philemon with a letter that Pliny the Younger wrote about a similar situation. He says that \"Nobody in the ancient world was thinking quite like Paul was thinking\", and \"Even if this book was the only Christian document from the first century it would show that something remarkable was going on\".\nWright emphesizes Paul's concern for reconciliation—radical and costly reconciliation across huge class barriers. He points out parallels between the runaway slave Onesimus and the parable of the Prodigal Son: the gospel calls for an extravagent welcome home for a runaway.\nN.T. Wright thinks that the letter to Philemon was written from prison in Ephesus (John Pollock thinks that Paul spent time in prison in Ephesus, but wrote Philemon from his later imprisonment in Rome). As mentioned above, the book of Acts does not directly state that Paul spent time in prison in Ephesus, but that may have been due to the political sensitivity of association with Proconsul Silanus. I found a couple of academic papers that also make the case that Paul spent time in prison there.\nI hope some of my readers found this post interesting. I'll finish it off with a link to an unrelated but insightful sermon on Cain I listened to recently.\nPermalink",

So it's nice to read about its increasing popularity.\nThe world of cryptocurrencies has a lot more to it than just Bitcoin. Another one that interests me is Ethereum: it raises some possibilities in the field of smart contracts.\nThe links I shared in the fall included a biographical article about James Watt. This time, I have articles about two people to share:\nIf you're in Toronto and looking to explore some hidden/lost/vestigal streams, the Lost Rivers project may be of interest. In northern New Brunswick, check out Chaleur Green Trails.\nThis is a neat article about the science of brewing coffee and tea.\nI came across a lengthy review of a series by Neal Stephenson.\nThe company I work for is headquartered in Pittsburgh, so reading about that city's post-industrial renaissance was cool.\nA completely different post-industrial landscape can be found in the Caspian Sea—seasteading Soviet-style. The photos in this article are incredible. There is an art show currently at UNB (until April 6) that sounds like (I haven't been there yet) it also has photos from that region or nearby.\nIt's not getting as much attention (being more of a slow-motion affair, with less organized violence), but apparently the exodus of people from Venezuela is on a similar scale (over 1 million people have left the country in the past 2 years) to the refugee crisis in places like Myanmar.\nMaps are cool. These ones analyzing US–Mexico cross-border cities were really neat.\nSome documentaries I've watched, like Earth: A New Wild and Frozen Planet have featured reindeer herding. Apparently the free-range nature of these herds is leading to friction in Finland. The interplay between wildlife and property rights is relevant to my interests. On the subject of Earth: A New Wild, this blog post critiques one of the concepts it covers. A conservation approach that is meeting with some successs is pop-up wetlands; I read about them in a book (or possibly two) I reviewed.\nRight now I'm reading The Dragon's Path, a novel by Daniel Abraham. He is half of the team behind The Expanse (the show returns on April 11); I've also read a great short story by him. I'm only a third of the way through the book (the first in a series) but I'm really enjoying it so far. Similar to A Song of Ice And Fire it brings gritty realism into a fantasy setting but I find it less grim than George R.R. Martin's work (and also faster-paced). It is well-written—even characters that do or support some awful things are believable, even sympathetic. One of my favourite characters is Cithrin, an orphan girl who was raised as the ward of a banking house. She relates a lot of things back to lessons her guardian taught her about finance, like in this excerpt where she considers flirting as negotiation:\nImplicit exchange was something Magister Imaniel had talked about several times, and always with disdain. He'd liked the precision of measuring coin. Here, in the warmth of the taproom, the tastes of salted meat and fortified wine warming her blood, Cithrin wasn't sure she agreed. Surely imprecision had its place.\nThis was a good podcast episode about civility online. The same podcast had another episode recently about the book Soonish that was also interesting.\nOn April 7, the Paddling Film Festival comes to Fredericton. I hope to attend.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post continues my journey through Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce Tate. This week's language was Erlang, the first Functional language in the book (although Scala is a hybrid language that incorporates features of the functional paradigm).\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nErlang seems to be sort of a niche language for telecommunication applications, although it does have some very useful/versatile features (e.g. list comprehension). It takes some obvious inspiration from Prolog as Bruce Tate explains:\nErlang is a functional language. It is strongly, dynamically typed. There is not a lot of syntax, but what is there is not at all like the typical object-oriented languages.\nLike Prolog, Erlang has no notion of an object. However, Erlang does have a strong connection to Prolog. The pattern matching constructs and multiple function entry points should look familiar to you, and you handle some problems in the same way, through recursion. The functional language has no notion of mutable state or even side effects.\nI also wanted to include the author's explanation of \"list comprehension\" since that was a feature that really impressed me (apparently other languages have them too, but I've not come across them before):\nOne of the most important functions in just about any functional language is map. With it, your lists can mutate... Since the feature is so important, Erlang provides a more powerful form that is concise and allows you to do multiple transformations at once.\nHere is the summary of this feature from Seven Languages in Seven Weeks:\nHere are some of my notes on Erlang functions, syntax, etc.:\nAs with the previous posts in this series, I have a couple of examples to share. The first one is from Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. The module is called \"obligatory\" and it defines functions to calculate factorials and Fibonacci numbers (practically an obligatory exercise when learning a programming language). These functions are fact/1 and fib/1, respectively, and they are both defined recursively. The /1 in the function names means they have an \"arity\" (number of arguments) of 1. As mentioned above, the definition statements with a number as the argument will only match that number, while a capital letter (N) acts as a variable so it can match other cases.\nHere is how this module is compiled and the functions are run. Note how Erlang can deal with very large numbers (and these calculations were quick):\nAs expected, fib(18) + fib(19) = fib(20).\nThe other example is from the self-study assignments for the second day. The function is only a single line in this case, but it demonstrates list comprehension syntax. The function is getval and it takes a list (of key-value pairs in the form of tuples) and a key (X) as arguments. To the right of the double bars (||) in the list comprehension it matches the contents of the list to the expected structure (key-value pairs in a tuple). This is a generator. After the comma is a filter so that only the given key will match. To the left of the double bars, it simply returns the value that satisfies all of these constraints (but you can also use this feature to return multiple elements with a specified structure):\nHere is how this module is compiled and the function is called:\nI didn't really look up links for further reading on Erlang, but if this language interests you, here's the guide for getting started.\nI've sort of rushed through the last two languages, partly because I've been really busy with other stuff and partly because they didn't catch my interest as much (i.e. Erlang seems to mainly get used for communication and database applications which are not really what I'm into)—although I did find Erlang was a decent way to get my toes wet in the functional paradigm. However, the next two languages (Clojure and Haskell) are ones that seem rather intriguing, so I'm looking forward to going through them. They continue with this paradigm and wrap up the book. Before I get to them, though, there will probably be an interlude with a post or two not in this series.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I'm now past the half-way point of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. This week was about the language Scala. Due to time constraints and interest level, I haven't given it quite as much attention as some of the other languages the book has looked at so far.\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nHere is how Bruce Tate introduces Scala:\nIt's a hybrid language, meaning that it intentionally tries to bridge the gaps between programming paradigms. In this case, the bridge is between object-oriented languages like Java and functional languages like Haskell.\nIts placement in the middle chapter of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks seems very deliberate. Scala is a language that works with object-oriented and functional paradigms. I've gotten some exposure to object-oriented concepts in the chapters on Ruby and Io. The remaining chapters in the book are about functional languages: Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell. My main goal from this chapter was to reinforce some object-oriented concepts and get an introduction to some functional ones, so I didn't mind skipping over a few things (like concurrency) to save time.\nScala ran slower on my netbook than the other languages so far have. I think that's because it compiles everything to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) before running it.\nHere are some useful methods from Scala along with my other notes from the chapter:\nHere are some examples of Scala:\nOne of the examples in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks was to create a class called Compass that knows how to turn left and right around the cardinal directions. Here is a screenshot (from gedit) because I think this one is easier to follow with some syntax highlighting:\nIn this example, directions is a list containing the cardinal directions. bearing is a mutable (declared with var) variable that serves as its index. direction() is a function with no argument that simply returns the element from directions at the current bearing. inform() is a function that takes a single parameter (the string \"left\" or \"right\") and prints a statement saying what way it is turning and what direction it is facing. It uses + to concatenate some strings. turnRight() and turnLeft() are functions with no parameters. They update the bearing (the index for directions), using the modulus operator (%) to wrap around directions instead of going out of range. At the bottom of the script, a new object is created from the Compass class and the .turnRight and .turnLeft methods are called.\nI mentioned above that the .foldLeft method is quite powerful. In honour of Pi Day, I wrote this method to calculate pi by alternately adding and subtracting reciprocals of odd numbers (the Madhava-Leibniz-Gregory method):\nThis function takes an integer as an argument (the number of terms to include in the series). It creates a range to get the requested number of terms then uses the .foldLeft method to do the calculation. The initial value (1.0) is given then an anonymous function based on the result so far (piByFour) and the current element of the range (term). The modulus operator is used to alternate between +1 / -1 which is then divided by an odd number calculated from the current element of the range. I found it kind of tough to do math in Scala because of the way it infers object types. The math operators were looking for Int or Double types while I was trying to use Float types. Eventually I made everything a Double and got it working.\nI really liked the ease of using xml in Scala. I tried the examples in the book on some simplified/contrived kml (kml uses the same structure as xml, just different tags); I've played with kml quite a bit before, so I could really see the potential usefulness here:\nplaces is an xml object. Calling .text on it strips away the tags. places \\ \"coordinates\" shows the node(s) with the <coordinates> tag. places \\ \"@id\"\nshows the contents of the id= attribute.\nI didn't look for any links for further reading on Scala.\nI'm finding it very helpful to see the same concepts/paradigm in multiple languages. After seeing some object-oriented concepts in Ruby, Io, and now Scala I feel like I'm getting a better understanding overall. Classes and code blocks in Scala took less time to pick up on than in Ruby and I don't think that's because the language is simpler. As I look ahead to the final half of the book (functional languages Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell), I'm hoping that the bridge provided by Scala will kickstart the same process of understanding in the Functional paradigm.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post continues my series on Seven Language in Seven Weeks by Bruce Tate. As in the previous posts, I'm going to share my notes on this chapter, including a few excerpts, some significant methods, snippets of code, and links for further reading.\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nI said last week that I was a bit excited about Prolog. That's because it is very different from any languages I've used before. Prolog is a declarative language (so it might help get into the right mindset for the functional languages later in the book) rather than an imperative one. This means that you specify constraints on a problem instead of an algorithm for solving it.\nHere is a brief description of Prolog from Bruce Tate:\nProlog programming has two major steps. Start by building a knowledge base, composed of logical facts and inferences about the problem domain. Next, compile your knowledge base, and ask questions about the domain. Some of the questions can be assertions and Prolog will respond with yes or no*. Other queries have variables. Prolog fills in these gaps that makes those queries true.\nRather than simple assignment, Prolog uses a process called unification that makes variables on both sides of a system match. Sometimes, Prolog has to try many different possible combinations of variables to unify variables for an instance.\n*The interpreter I was using (SWI-Prolog) uses true and false instead.\nTo use Prolog, you develop a \"knowledge base\" of facts and rules in a .pl file (I simply used the gedit text editor to write these) and then load it into an interpreter and make queries about it. As mentioned, I used the SWI-Prolog interpreter; the examples in the book used GNU Prolog (so there were a few things that didn't work exactly as described). Facts are typically written as relation(argument1, argument2). —note that it is important to end with a period and use all lowercase letters. For example, the fact capital(fredericton, newbrunswick). means Fredericton is the capital of New Brunswick. There can be facts with more (or less) than two arguments. Typical rules might be written as relation(X,Y) :- subgoal1, subgoal2, subgoal3. —again, they need to end with a period but arguments will mostly be replaced with variables (variables always begin with a capital letter but can be more than one letter). Sub-goals (I used 3 for example, but there can be any number) to the right of :- must all be true for the rule to be met (if they are separated by commas; semicolons indicate any sub-goal can be true). Variables can be used in the sub-goals and so can the relation itself (for recursion).\nIn the interpreter, you can call on facts and rules (filled in with appropriate arguments) after loading the file with the knowledge base. If you call on them with values in lower-case, Prolog will tell you whether the fact or rule is true or false for those values. If you call on a fact/rule with variables (in upper-case) as the arguments (or a mix of variables and fixed values), it will tell you what values those variables can/must take to satisfy all of the relevant facts and rules. This process of binding variables with the values that make both sides of a rule match is known as \"unification\". Note that Prolog may find multiple possible solutions (in which case you can press ; at the prompt to see the next one) or none (in which case it simply says false). Also note that Prolog doesn't remember the values of variables between queries, so you can use a common variable (e.g. X or What) in repeated queries without any problems.\nProlog has some built-in methods (I'm not sure if they are the same between different interpreter implementations, however), but simply knowing the basic syntax goes a long way. Compared to the other languages in the series so far, I just have a short list of things to know:\nA lot of what I've tried to describe so far is pretty abstract. Hopefully the following examples will demonstrate how Prolog can be used:\nOne of the examples Bruce Tate gives in the chapter on Prolog is using it to determine how a map can be coloured without two territories of the same colour touching each other. This is a problem that is very well-suited to Prolog because even though it can be complicated for certain maps it is simple to define the conditions that must be met. I liked his example so I decided to try to solve it in a different way for practice:\nAt the start of this knowledge base I've stated four facts to define colours that may be used. Next comes a rule that if X and Y border each other, they can't be the same colour. Finally is the rule called mapping that has six states as its arguments (note that they start with capital letters so they act as variables). This rule has a number of subgoals that basically require that each state be matched with a colour and that certain states have to follow the border rule (already defined: they must be different colours) since they are next to each other.\nIn the interpreter, I simply load the knowledge base then use the mapping rule as a query.\nIt ends with a semi-colon (that I typed to continue, then cut off the rest of the results) since there are other possible colouring patterns. I allowed for four colours and only three were needed so that creates a lot of additional possibilities.\nThe other example I wrote is to solve the viral logic puzzle from a few years ago about #CherylsBirthday. This article presents the puzzle and explains the solution (SPOILER ALERT: don't scroll down if you want to try it yourself first). Here it is in Prolog:\nI'm sure there is a more succinct way to solve this (perhaps if I was better at handling lists in Prolog, or knew how to find unique days or months in a single step). The initial facts are the months and days that are possible, then the specific dates that Cheryl offered as possibilities (round0 is before Albert or Bernard have received any additional information). In round1, we know that it has to be a month without a unique day or else there is the possibility that Bernard might have enough information to solve it on his own (e.g. if Bernard got the number nineteen then the only possibility would be May 19th). I didn't know how to find months with unique days in a single step so I defined a rule for non-unique days then set a sub-goal to find its logical negation (using \\+). In round2, the first rule asks for (Month, Day) combinations that passed the rules of round1 to use the process of elimination. Since Bernard can guess correctly after some months have been ruled out by Albert's comment, the process of looking for unique days is repeated (but only on possibilities that haven't been ruled out). Finally, a similar procedure is used in round3 to find a month with only one possible day (since knowing the month now gives Albert enough information to correctly guess Cheryl's birthday) considering only the combinations that passed round2.\nHere are the results when I loaded this into the interpreter and made a query:\nActually, it was an iterative process of making lots of queries that didn't identify Cheryl's birthday then tweaking the rules and trying again.\nBruce Tate points out that Prolog is kind of a niche language. Some problems are ideal to approach in this logical way of defining constraints and then letting the software find cases where the variables can match up with the rules. Aside from the map colouring problem, another great example in the book is a Sudoku solver. Other problems can be frustrating to attempt with Prolog. If you don't have the logic of the problem completely defined it will either give you too many possible answers (if it is under-constrained) or no answer, just false (if it is over-constrained).\nEach chapter in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks has an interview with someone involved in creating the language or someone who uses it for interesting applications. This chapter spoke with Brian Tarbox, a researcher on dolphin cognition. He talked about using Prolog to model what words and commands dolphins could understand and also developing lab schedules (with a lot of constraints such as when personnel with certain skills or special equipment or facilities were available). The interview was a nice glimpse of situations where Prolog can be very useful.\nFinally, here are some links for further reading/study on Prolog:\nPermalink",

    "content": "Continuing the series I started last week, this post is about the entry in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks on the prototyping language Io. As before, I'm going to share my notes on this chapter, including a few excerpts, some significant methods, snippets of code, and links for further reading.\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nHere is how Bruce Tate describes Io:\nNames are sometimes deceiving, but you can tell a lot from Io. It's simultaneously reckless (ever try Googling for Io?) and brilliant. ... The language's syntax is simple and low-level, like the name. Io syntax simply chains messages together, with each message returning an object and each message taking optional parameters in parentheses. In Io, everything is a message that returns another receiver. ...\nWith Io, you won't worry about both classes and objects. You'll deal exclusively in objects, cloning them as needed. ... In a prototype language, every object is a clone of an existing object rather than a class. Io gets you about as close to object-oriented Lisp as you're likely to get.\nNote that Seven Languages in Seven Weeks was published in 2010. Since then, .io has become a very popular TLD (top level domain)—including for the service that hosts this blog—as this article from 2013 points out. So the Googling hurdle is even higher than it used to be.\nAs the author points out, Io is a very straight-forward language with a simple syntax (but don't confuse simplicity for limited functionality). I felt like I was getting the hang of it faster than with Ruby. And it was fun to play around with.\nAfter going through this chapter, my understanding of \"prototyping\" languages like Io is that they offer a sparse, trimmed-down take on object-oriented programming. By not dealing with classes, I found it easier to grasp the point of the core object-oriented approach of bundling related data and methods together in an object. As I state at the end of this post, I think Io could be a great language to use in education for that reason.\nHopefully, this post can provide a good explanation of objects in Io, starting with another quote from Bruce Tate:\nThis is how Io's object model works. Objects are just containers of slots. Get a slot by sending its name to an object. If the slot isn't there, Io calls the parent. That's all you have to understand. There are no classes or metaclasses. You don't have interfaces or modules. You just have objects.\nObjects (which are named starting with a capital letter by convention) have slots (assigned by :=) which can contain data or a method. But if I understand correctly, slots can act as objects themselves (on a lower level) and objects can be seen as slots of the Lobby. Since slots have a name and contents, objects are basically structured like hashes (which comprise key–value pairs); in fact, you can call the asObject method on a hash object (a clone of Map) in Io to convert its contents to slots.\nTypical syntax in Io would be something like Object slot message(arguments). Each word is a message that gets passed to the result of whatever has already been evaluated to its left. So in this case, slot gets passed to Object and identifies some data for example. Then message gets passed to that and acts on it. All objects are cloned from existing objects in a chain that eventually reaches back to the default Object and the Lobby. If a message is sent to an object and it is not the name of a slot on that object, then Io looks up the chain of that object's prototypes (\"protos\") until it finds a meaning for the message (this uses the forward method). This means that methods or data defined for an object are effectively inherited by anything cloned from it unless slots of the same name are defined for the clones.\nI've alluded to some methods and objects in Io already, but this seems like a good place to list some examples that I think are interesting or useful:\nHere are a couple of sample snippets of code from Io to illustrate what I've tried to explain. The first one is from Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, showing how to use OperatorTable addOperator to define an xor function.\nAfter inserting the new operator into the OperatorTable at the appropriate precedence position, it gets defined for true and false, then it is applied to check that it gives the expected results.\nAnother example in the book involved redefining forward (which is a method that exists in the lobby) as a short-cut to making an .xml builder: unknown messages would get printed as .xml syntax instead of passed to the prototype. I think the author likes this kind of hack, because he used .method_missing for a similar purpose in the previous chapter on Ruby.\nThis next example is one that I wrote for one of the exercises in the book. It calculates and prints the average of a list. Not very succintly, but it demonstrates working with lists and putting methods into slots (note that the methods are put in slots on List and because the list a was cloned from that object it has access to those methods):\nHere are some links for further reading:\nAt the end of each chapter, Bruce Tate discusses strengths and weakness of the language. I feel like one area where Io has a lot of potential is in education. With just 3 or 4 hours over the course of a week, Io helped me gain a better understanding of some object-oriented programming concepts as well as concurrency.\nThe language in the next chapter is Prolog, which I'm a bit excited to dig into.\nPermalink",

    "content": "As I mentioned last week, I'm trying to work through the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce Tate this winter. This first week was about the object-oriented language Ruby.\nWeek 1 ˙ Week 2 ˙ Week 3 ˙ Week 4 ˙ Week 5 ˙ Week 6 ˙ Week 7\nFor this first post in the series, I'll start with a few comments about the book. Bruce Tate has a straight-forward writing style and seems to have put a lot of thought into the choice of seven languages to cover (i.e. they span a few different programming paradigms). The Introduction provides some background on those choices and also some advisories about what to expect from the book. For example, he warns that he doesn't tell the reader how to install any of the languages. This was no problem for me as all but one (Io) were available in the Ubuntu repositories.\nIn flipping through the other chapters, it appears that the structure of the chapter on Ruby is typical, so I'll say a bit about it here. Aside from a brief introduction and some concluding thoughts (on the strengths and weaknesses of the language), it is split into three \"days\". Each day had walkthroughs of some features of the language with example code and then a self-study section with suggestions of things to look up and problems to solve. Having a full-time job, I often split the walkthrough and self-study over separate days. Over the course of the week, I'd estimate I put about 6 hours into it.\nMy previous programming/scripting experience has been in procedural languages (R and octave) so the object-oriented and functional languages in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks will be a stretch for me—hopefully I can learn some new ways of approaching problems.\nWith this prelude out of the way, the rest of the post will share some of my notes about Ruby. These will include notable methods, some quotes from Bruce Tate, links for further reading, and a few annotated code snippets. I expect future posts in this series (which will likely take more than 7 weeks to get through, especially if I have to travel for my job during this timeframe) to follow a similar format. Later on, I have a few mini-projects in mind that I may apply the languages from the book that I like best to; however, learning the language and trying a project in a single week is too much.\nHere is how Bruce Tate describes Ruby:\nAs a language, Ruby is an interpreted, object-oriented, dynamically typed language from a family of so-called scripting languages. Interpreted means that Ruby code is executed by an interpreter rather than a compiler. Dynamically typed means that types are bound at execution time rather than compile time. In general, the trade-off for such a strategy is flexibility versus execution safety, but we'll get into that a little more later. Object-oriented means that the language supports encapsulation (data and behavior are packaged together), inheritance through classes (object types are organized in a class tree), and polymorphism (objects can take many forms).\nHere are some notes on methods and objects in Ruby that I thought seemed especially relevant or useful:\nHere are some links for further reading/research:\nFinally, here are a few snippets of code from exercises in the book that illustrate some of the syntax and features of Ruby:\nThis defines a hash (the keys are words in English and the entries are translations in other languages—Duolingo likes making sentences with words like these so they came to mind pretty quickly) then iteratively prints the values from it:\nThis opens a file then prints lines that match a regular expression (a very basic regular expression that is just looking for the word \"puts\"):\nThis example shows a range and how to insert variable text into a string:\nThis interactive session peeks at the hierarchy of Classes for a number object (I used 4):\nWithout previous experience in object-oriented programming, a week wasn't really enough time to get the hang of Modules or metaprogramming in Ruby. I'm not even entirely sure of my understanding of classes yet. However, there is another object-oriented language (Scala) in Seven Languages in Seven Weeks, so that chapter should help provide more exposure to those concepts.\nThe language in the next chapter is Io.\nPermalink",

    "content": "There is a project I have in mind for this winter (more on that at the end of this post) that I want to use Linux for. I have an old Acer netbook that was running Ubuntu 10.04 so I decided to update it to a more recent release. It also seemed like a convenient time to review some open-source software I appreciate and make sure it got re-installed after the update.\nInitially, I tried to upgrade from within my existing OS installation (following instructions such as here and here). However, updating from end of life releases is a major challenge, so eventually I decided to download a recent version of Ubuntu and install it from a live USB. I went with Xubuntu 16.04, because it is an LTS (long term support) release. Xubuntu uses the Xfce desktop, which is lighter than the desktop used by regular Ubuntu (however, see below for a number of applications where I do prefer the GNOME version).\nTo make the bootable/live USB, I used Rufus. It was quite a smooth process to reinstall the new version after that, and it even kept my /home directory intact. Then I proceeded to find some open-source software that I wanted to [re]-install:\nThere is some other open-source software that I haven't installed yet, but still wanted to mention:\nI installed a couple of Go programs (CGoban and Gnu Go) on my netbook, but I haven't tried them yet. On my phone, I've recently started using JoyGo; the AI is harder than on the old app I was using so I'm losing consistently. Time to read up on strategy some more.\nOn the subject of phone apps, this one is useful for locating parks and preserves to explore in New Brunswick.\nFinally, I'll share about the project I mentioned in the introduction. I'm planning to go through the book Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce A. Tate. It gives brief lessons in: Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell. I certainly don't expect to become skilled at any of these languages in that amount of time, but I'm hoping to pick up some new approaches for problem solving and a basic understanding of different programming paradigms. My plan is to write some blog posts as I work through this book (don't count on them all being posted in the next seven weeks, though).\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about a book on geometry that I read last year (finishing up over the holidays).\nBeautiful Geometry was written by Eli Maor and Eugen Jost. Each of its 51 chapters explains a topic in geometry and presents an artistic plate illustrating it. In addition to the artistic interpretations, there are plenty of diagrams to assist with the explanations. I found it to be well-written and effectively structured—the chapters tend to build on previous ones. The ancient Greeks considered geometry as the core of mathematics; in modern times it doesn't always get as much attention as other fields. Beautiful Geometry is a worthwhile read if you think geometry deserves some attention. I definitely learned some things from this book, and even with respect to material that I was familiar with, I still enjoyed the clear explanations and the illustrations.\nIn this review, I'm going to share some things from Beautiful Geometry that I found interesting.\nThe arithmetic mean is the familiar average (sum divided by n). The geometric mean is the n-th root of the product of n numbers and the harmonic mean is n divided by the sum of the reciprocals. One of the early chapters (chapter 10) had some theorems about these means.\nA well-known theorem says that of the three means, the harmonic mean is always the smallest, the arithmetic mean is the largest, and the geometric mean somewhere in between.\nThe geometric mean of [numbers] is also the geometric mean of [their arithmetic mean and harmonic mean].\nThe book included geometric proofs for these theorems.\nTheorems from Euclid (one of those ancient Greeks) feature prominently in the early chapters. Chapter 12 ties a couple of them together, concerning lines that cut a circle:\nThe two theorems we just met—numbers 35 and 36 in book III of Euclid—sound strikingly similar: both are about a circle, a point P, and a line through P the cuts the circle at points R and S. The two theorems state that the product PR ✗ PS remains constant for all possible lines through P. Yet there is a difference: in theorem 35 P is inside the circle while in theorem 36 it is outside. ...\nAnd yet a closer inspection will show that the two theorems are one and the same after all. For when we say that a point P is given with respect to a circle, we imply only that the distance OP from P to the center of the circle O is given, and nothing else.\nThese two theorems are combined into a single statement (it's much easier to follow with the diagrams they include):\nIf through a point P a line is drawn that cuts a circle (O,r) at points R and S, the product PR ✗ PS is constant for all possible lines through P. If P is outside (O,r), this product is the square of the tanget from P to [the circle].\nI think conic sections are a cool topic because of the way they tie together types of curves that seem very different at first. Chapter 29 includes this description:\nImagine slicing a cone—for illustration's sake think of it as an ice cream cone—with a swift stroke of a knife. If you slice it in a plane parallel to the cone's base, you get a circular cross section. Tilt the angle slightly, and you get an ellipse. Tilt the angle even more, and the ellipse becomes narrower, until it no longer closes on itself: it becomes a parabola. This happens when the cut is parallel to the side of the cone. Increase the angle yet again, and you get two disconnected curves, the two branches of a hyperbola (provided you regard the cone as a double cone joined at its apex).\nI'm reminded of this passage from Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson (it involves the fictional character Daniel Waterhouse interacting with Sir Isaac Newton):\nStretch a line, and another intersecting it, and rotate the former about the latter and it will sweep out a cone. Now shove this cone through a plane and mark every point on the plane where the cone touches it. Commonly the result is an ellipse, but if the cone's slope is parallel to the plane it makes a parabola, and if it's parallel to the axis it makes a two-part curve called a hyperbola.\nAn interesting feature of all of these curves—the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola—was that they were all generated by straight things, viz. two lines and a plane. An interesting feature of the hyperbola was that far away its legs came very close to being straight lines, but near the center there was dramatic curvature.\nGreeks, e.g., Euclid, had done all of these things long ago [this book is set in the 18th Century] and discovered various more or less interesting properties of conic sections (as this family of curves was called) and of other geometric constructions such as circles and triangles. But they'd done so as an expression of pure thought, as a mathematician might compute the sum of two numbers. Every assertion that Euclid, et al., made concerning geometry was backed up by a chain of logical proofs that could be followed all the way back to a few axioms that were obviously true, e.g., \"the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\" The truths of geometry were necessary truths; the human mind could imagine a universe in which Daniel's name was David, or in which Ipswich had been built on the other side of the Orwell, but geometry and math had to be true, there was no conceivable universe in which 2+3 was equal to 2+2.\n...\nComets passed freely through space, their trajectories shaped only by (still mysterious) interactions with the Sun. If they moved on conic sections, it was no accident. A comet following a precise hyperbolic trajectory through the aether was a completely different thing from Daniel's just happening to trace a hyperbolic course through the English countryside [London to Cambridge, via Ipswich]. If comets and planets moved along conic sections, it had to be some kind of necessary truth, an intrinsic feature of the universe. ...\n... by asking for data on the interactions of the moon and sea, and of Jupiter and Saturn, Isaac was as much as saying that these were all of a piece, that everything attracted everything—that the influences on (say) Saturn of the Sun, of Jupiter, and of Titan ... were different only insofar as they came from different directions and had different magnitudes. Like the diverse goods piled up in some Amsterdam merchant's warehouse, they might have come from many places and have different values, but in the end all that mattered was how much gold they could fetch on the Damplatz. ... In the case of Cœlestial Dynamics, the gold—the universal medium of exchange, to which everything was reduced—was force. The force exerted on Saturn by the Sun was no different from that exerted by Titan. In the end, the two forces were added together to make a vector, a combined resultant force bearing no trace of its origins. (pp. 673 – 676)\nAnother kind of curve is a catenary. It is described in Chapter 33:\nOne of the outstanding problems that occupied the mathematical world in the years immediately following the invention of the calculus was to find the exact curve taken up by a chain of uniform thickness hanging freely under the force of gravity. To the eye, a hanging chain looks very much like a parabola, but the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) disproved this when he was just 17 years old. The mystery was solved in 1691 by three of the leading mathematicians of the time, who worked on it independently—Huygens himself (now 62), Leibniz, and Johann Bernoulli. To everyone's surprise, the shape turned out to be the graph of the hyperbolic cosine, (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2, which henceforth became known as the catenary.\nIn addition to the catenary, some members of the Bernoulli family also studied the properties of another curve (that looks quite similar) called a cycloid. Some more complicated curves that are derived from the cycloid—epicycloids and hypocycloids—are discussed in Chapter 36.\nEuler may well be the most famous mathematician in history. One of his lesser-known discoveries is the topic of Chapter 37. The Euler line connects the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter of a triangle:\nIn any triangle, the circumcenter (the center of the circumcircle), the centroid (the intersection of the three medians, so called because it is the center of gravity of the triangle), and the orthocenter (the intersection of the three altitudes), all lie on one line.\nA really interesting topic that I hadn't heard of before reading Beautiful Geometry is geometric inversion. Here is the description (from Chapter 38):\nConsider a circle with center at O and radius 1. Two points P and Q on the same ray through O are called inverses of each other with respect to the circle if ... OQ = 1/OP.\n...\nSince inversion maps points that are close to the center onto points far away from it, we expect that figures should be greatly distorted when subjected to inversion. Yet in spite of this, some figures do not change at all. Clearly, every ray through O is mapped on itself, and a circle with center at O and radius r becomes a circle with the same center and radius 1/r. More surprising is the fact that a circle through O is mapped onto a straight line not through O, and vice versa.\nA practical application of this concept is the Peaucellier inverter which can convert rotational motion to linear motion.\nI've mentioned previously on this blog that I like fractals. I wanted to give an example of one of the plates from Beautiful Geometry in this review; this presentation of the Koch snowflake seemed like a fitting choice:\nThe book has many other topics that I haven't touched on in this review. For example, Maor and Jost have a lot to say about the connections between geometry and number theory (primes, Fibonnaci numbers, irrational numbers, etc.).\nThe appendix contains a number of additional proofs, as well as instructions for how to draw a regular pentagon using only a compass and straight-edge. It's based on an intermediate step of constructing a right-angled triangle with side lengths of 1 and 0.5 to obtain the golden ratio (the length of the hypotenuse + the short side)—the golden ratio is the distance between opposite vertices of a pentagon with unit side lengths. I decided to try this construction myself:\nThis figure shows the steps in the construction (left to right, top to bottom). It didn't turn out perfectly, probably due to not using a good quality compass (I just used a piece of string, which stretched and slipped a bit).\nTo finish this post off with a nod to its title, the 9 point circle is a circle that connects 9 significant points in a triangle.\nPermalink",

    "content": "As in previous years, I've written the post below to provide a summary of New Brunswick's latest provincial budget, which was released today. I've also chosen to take a closer look at the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development this time.\nTo start with, here are some of the key estimates in the provincial budget for the fiscal year ahead (2018 – 2019). To facilitate comparisons, I'm stating everything in millions of Canadian dollars:\nThe departments with the largest budgets are as follows:\nThese budgets are for their ordinary accounts (which doesn't include capital spending, amortization, etc.). The department of Transportation and Infrastructure (which looks after most capital projects for the Provincial government) has a capital budget of $688M for 2018.\nThe following graph (using data from p.14 in the Budget document) shows the change in spending from 2017 to 2018 for a number of departments. In contrast to last year, I've graphed the magnitude of the change instead of the percentage (but the percentages are marked on the graph) since I found that the percentages put too much focus on relatively small changes to small departments. For example, the 3.4% increase in the Department of Health's budget is a bigger deal than the 11.7% increase in the budget for Agriculture, Aquaculture, and Fisheries. Also note that these changes are from the actual expenditures last year to the budgeted expenditures this year; General Government (which includes pensions and Service NB) has approximately the same budget this year as last year but it is showing up as a 3.2% decrease because their spending was higher in 2017 than estimated in the budget for that year.\nMajor anticipated sources of revenue for the Government of New Brunswick in 2018 include:\nProjected tax revenue is decreasing from $4571M in 2017. I'm not aware of significant changes to tax rates, so I assume this is due mainly to anticipated changes in the size of the tax base. Equalization payments are projected to increase from $1760M in 2017.\nThe following graph (using data from p.171 in the Budget document) shows the change in revenue, by source, from 2017 to 2018. As in the previous graph, it compares the estimated revenue for the fiscal year ahead to the actual revenue of the preceding fiscal year. Likewise, it focuses on the magnitude of the change.\nThere are two newsworthy things to note about NB taxes in 2018:\nIn my post last year I said:\nA significant point in my view is that the total expenditures [in the 2015 budget] were $8630M, which is less than current revenue. If the government had been able to hold spending increases lower, then the budget could have been balanced by now without true cuts.\nThis still holds true, as projected revenue for 2018 is $9427M. Here is a statistic that really puts these trends into perspective:\nSince 2007, provincial revenues have grown at an annual average rate of 2.5 per cent while spending has been growing at 3.1 per cent.\n0.6 percentage points (i.e. the difference between the growth rates of spending and revenue) doesn't seem like much, but it more than adds up\nLast year's budget post looked at the Department of Environment and Local Government. A recent news story seemed like a good follow-up to share on that topic: the city of Saint John wants to discuss amalgamation with some of its suburbs.\nAs mentioned above, the Provincial government is carving out a portion of the existing Gas Tax to be re-designated as a Climate Change Fund. This is to meet the mandate from Canada's Federal government that each province put a price on greenhouse gas emissions of $10/tonneCO2e, rising to $50/tonneCO2e by 2022 (so the Climate Change Fund will have to increase for the next five years). However, whether this plan will actually fulfill the criteria of the federal mandate is a bit unclear.\nWhen the federal carbon tax plan was announced, I shared the following back-of-the-envelope calculations on Facebook to illustrate its potential impact:\nBut what does $50/tonne CO2e actually mean? Most context in news articles is in terms of the price of gasoline since that is the most visible source to the average person. However, energy is used in everything, so I think the focus needs to widen away from just the transportation sector. Here is a brief case study on how a craft brewery might be impacted (a lot of people have probably toured a brewery at some point, so I think this is a relatable example).\nA typical craft brewery uses around 20 kWh of electricity and 150,000 Btu (0.16 GJ) of thermal energy per barrel brewed (a barrel is around 120 litres). In Canada, the electrical grid has an emissions factor of 0.18 kg CO2 per kWh. This is quite low compared to many other countries since the vast majority of our electricity comes from hydroelectric and nuclear generation; a kilowatt-hour in China is associated with 5x higher CO2 emissions since coal is such a major source of electrical generation there. For thermal energy, assuming the source is natural gas, emissions would be around 56 kg CO2 per GJ.\nUsing these numbers, brewing a barrel of beer would have associated CO2 emissions of: (20 kWh x 0.18 kg/kWh) + (0.16 GJ x 56 kg/GJ) = 3.6 kg + 9.0 kg = 12.6 kg. At $50/tonne, this is $0.63 per barrel. A craft brewery producing 50,000 – 100,000 barrels per year (this would be at the upper end of Canadian craft breweries) would thus be facing around $30,000 – $60,000 per year in added operating costs five years from now.\nTo look at the department of Education, I calculated per-student funding going back to 2000. I found enrollment numbers in reports on the Department of Education website (e.g. this one for the 2016 – 2017 school year) and the departmental budget from previous budget documents (available here). From 2012 forward, Early Childhood Development was part of the same department, so I subtracted its allocation from the departmental total. Here is a graph I made of Education funding divided by student enrollment (K – 12) by year:\nThe budget increased 43% from 2000 to 2016 (compared to 33% inflation over this timeframe) while enrollment dipped by 22% (125,000 students in 2000 to 98,000 in 2016; the number of schools also decreased from 336 in 2004 to 302 in 2016). The decrease in the number of students is probably due to generational demographics along with the shrinking population of the province as a whole. The combined effect of these two trends has been a steady increase in the spending per student.\nThe latest budget continues this trend. The Education budget (after subtracting $118M for Early Childhood Development) is $1140M for 2018. Dividing by 98,000 students (using 2016 enrollment since I don't have the most recent number available) gives $11,632 (not million) per student.\nUnfortunately, even as spending has increased, educational outcomes aren't doing so well. For example, recently-released assessment results revealed that less than 40% of anglophone Grade 6 students have an appropriate level of math skills.\nNew Brunswick is not alone in this: many other provinces and states have similar trends of spending more—above the rate of inflation—on education (and also health care, housing, etc.) while seeing stagnant results. This is an interesting discussion on the phenomenon.\nFinally, I'll note that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has a debt of $15500M (and a population of 528,000 vs 754,000 in NB) so what happens there with respect to that debt could serve as a sort of preview for New Brunswick.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A number of years ago, I wrote this post. I made a category tag for it, but haven't put anything else into that category—until now.\nDwarf Fortress is an iconic computer game. In it, the player directs a group of dwarves to dig into the ground, mine rocks and minerals, and construct a fortress. It is completely open-ended so it has no way to win (but lots of ways to have \"fun\"). Its graphics are extremely sparse, using coloured unicode characters to represent everything (dwarves are smiley faces, for example). But under the hood, it runs a very detailed simulation (to the extent that some players build working computers in their fortresses). And even though the graphics are 2D, it provides a fully 3-dimensional world (you can move the display through layers of dirt and rock using the < and > keys).\nI'd describe Dwarf Fortress as a fantasy mining simulator (it defines over 80 different kinds of rocks) that subtly encourages players to eventually—if they can last long enough—delve \"too greedily and too deep\". It has been frequently imitated, but, in my opinion, never quite equalled. I think the simplicity of the graphics and steep learning curve engages players' imaginations more than more polished and user-friendly games.\nIt'd been a few years since the last time I played, but over the holidays I started a new fortress. With its detailed simulation, the game lets you check the total wealth of your fortress at any time (by pressing z to see the status screen). I kept a record of the wealth of my fortress as it developped because I thought it could make for an interesting illustration/exploration of some concepts in economics.\nIf you want to give this game a try, I recommend reading this guide. It includes a useful flowchart for building the basic elements that most fortresses need.\n\"Strike the earth!\", says the opening message. Initially, there is no fortress, just 7 dwarves and a wagon full of supplies. The dwarven calendar consists of 4 seasons of 3 months of 28 days each. I built my fortress for 3 years of in-game time. The following figure shows my fortress at the end of the third year. Its animation switches between the surface and the first eight underground layers (the mining tunnels continued down to 40 layers below the surface where some caverns were found). I added some labels of key areas of the fortress, too:\nOn the surface, you can see a goblin army (the group of purple gs) that has arrived to besiege the fortress. There is also a pallisaded arena—goblin thieves that skulked in one-by-one often got captured in cage traps, then I had them chained in the arena for my military squads to practice on.\nDown in the heart of my fortress, you can see a water reservoir. There is a shaft leading to the surface and a flood gate connecting it to the river. I used the flood gate to fill the reservoir, but left it open a bit too long. The water actually overflowed through a well shaft (this illustrates how detailed the simulation is) and flooded a higher level of my fortress. At least one dwarf died in the flood; because I didn't bury him properly*, he came back as a ghost.\n*In the time that I've spent playing DF, something I've never fully gotten the hang of is garbage management and related stuff like proper burials.\nAs I mentioned, at the end of year three a goblin army (totalling 16 invaders) arrived for a siege. I fought them off at the start of year four (not included in the data below), but at the cost of 9 soldiers. Here is the aftermath of the battle:\nThe following screenshot shows my fortress' status at the end of year 3. The wealth created in my fortress reached a total of 179,000 ⚙ (⚙ is the dwarven currency) while the imported wealth was 105,300 ⚙ and the exported wealth was 10,387 ⚙. I had a population of 129 dwarves along with 71 livestock. The stockpiles of food and drink were 3000 and 30, respectively.\nWhile I was playing, I checked the status screen periodically and recorded the wealth, population, and corresponding in-game date. The following graphs show how the population of my fortress and its total wealth developped over time. The dates are listed as month/day. The population grew mainly through immigration, although children started being born sometime in the second year if I recall correctly. The imported wealth mainly comprised the possessions immigrants brought with them, although it also includes goods traded for (totalling less than the 10,387 ⚙ that was exported) and items seized from would-be thieves. A notable fact about the produced wealth is that occasionally a dwarf will be seized with inspiration/madness and make a valuable artifact in a workshop. After 3 years, my fortress had 5 artifacts totalling 38,520 ⚙, which represents more than 20% of the wealth produced during that period.\nThe next graph was made by looking at each season/quarter and dividing the change in fortress wealth during that period by the average population during the same period. It shows the per capita (per dwarf) rate of value-added production and how it varied over time. In spite of the title, this isn't exactly the same thing as GDP, as discussed in the subsequent section.\nGDP can be calculated in a few different ways. One is as the gross value added. Another is the sum of consumption (which can include goods kept in inventory for future consumption), investment, government spending, and net exports. By tracking the fortress' wealth over time, I was only capturing the value-added portion, since intermediate goods used to make something else would be removed from the overall tally. So the graph above mostly reflects the former calculation method (the total wealth on the status screen was conveniently separated into \"created\" and \"imported\" portions already). What's missing is that it only captures the production of durable goods: for example, food that gets eaten is clearly part of value-added production, but it wasn't accounted for in my graph; additionally, the service economy wasn't included. In the real world, these would be big omissions, but dwarven industries heavily focus on the production of durable goods. In fact, the dwarves are described as \"short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry.\" Regarding the consumption of food and drink, dwarves need 2 units of food and 4 units of drink per season. If this need was satisfied with wine and cheese (both of which were available in my fortress, although the wine came close to running out a couple of times) the associated value would be 28 ⚙ per dwarf—so around 10% extra GDP per quarter than I calculated. Regarding the service economy, the main jobs in that sector were a few dwarves assigned (part-time) to administrative tasks (like bookkeeping) and a few squads of soldiers. Maybe around 15% of the workforce was in such jobs, so that could serve as a first approximation of the size of the dwarven service economy.\nThe latter calculation method for GDP mentioned above can also shed some light on what is and isn't included in my analysis. Outright consumption was minimal, but the increasing sizes of stockpiles can be counted under that category. The wealth of the fortress includes its architecture, so investment was captured in my analysis. The service sector in the fortress relates to government spending, and as I've discussed already it can only be roughly estimated. Net exports were low (I traded 10,387 ⚙ to visiting caravans but received almost as much back in exchange) and all imported goods (which mainly were the possessions that came with migrants) were left out of the final graph anyway.\nIn the final graph, the per capita quarterly (equivalent to seasonally) production (excluding the service sector and consumed food and drink, as discussed) increased initially then settled to a fairly steady rate of approximately 350 ⚙ before oscillating then starting a decline. To wrap this post up, I'll offer some interpretation of the trends and discussion of relevant economic concepts:\nReal GDP per person is a blunt instrument to measure overall quality of life, because GDP lumps together all financial transactions. If you get beaten and mugged, the costs of your health care, having to replace your mobile phone, and the policing that fails to catch the criminals are included in GDP. The Good Samaritans who chase away the muggers, notify the neighbors, and offer to babysit your kids while you’re in the hospital are not included in GDP. Also, the painkillers you purchase on the down low from your brother-in-law and the pet sitter you pay under the table are not included\nPermalink",

    "content": "Over the holidays I watched some documentaries on Netflix. I thought I'd share some of the things I found interesting for my first post of 2018.\nTo start with, here are a couple of great clips from some BBC nature documentaries:\nHuman Planet showed a traditional narwhal hunt from kayaks:\nPlanet Earth 2 had an incredible \"hyperlapse\" of Hong Kong:\nAside from rewatching parts of those incredible series, another science/nature documentary series I watched was Alien Deep. It follows the underwater explorations of Dr. Robert Ballard—best known for his discovery of the wreck of the Titanic. The series consists of five episodes of around 45 minutes each.\nThe first episode visits what they dub \"Hawaii's next island\", an underwater volcano next to the Big Island. The research team did a carefully-coordinated two-sub dive to the volcano; the episode also provided explanations about plate tectonics.\nIn the second episode, they were looking for shipwrecks in deep water (but still in sight of land, it appeared) in the Mediterranean north of Rhodes. The purpose of this was to prove that ancient seafarers were willing to cross open water instead of always hugging the coast. Additionally, shallow wrecks have often been visited by divers so deeper ones are better preserved. They found a Byzantine and a Greek wreck (and also a modern sailboat). Most of the extant remains of these ships were amphorae, still clustered in the outline of the holds. This episode reminded me of things I read in the book The Sea & Civilization.\nIn the next episode three crews visited hydrothermal vents in the Pacific, Atlantic (mid-ocean ridge), and Mediterranean. Hydrothermal vents represent food chains completely isolated from the energy of the sun. The ocean is continually renewed with key elements as water recirculates through them. Dr. Ballard made the point that Iceland is at the terminus of the mid-Ocean ridge and its unique landscapes are echoed underwater. At the end of the episode they visited a new volcanic island to witness early succession ecology.\nThe fourth episode was about rogue waves. I learned that the tallest wave on record was 23 metres! Dr. Ballard visited Lloyd's of London to look at records of shipwrecks, investigating whether storms and waves are getting bigger; boat pilots at the mouth of the Columbia River and surfers in Tahiti who were interviewed in this episode both think so. This episode also had good descriptions of swell formation and ocean circulation (the global conveyor) that reminded me of a book I read called Waves and Beaches. Finally, they interviewed researchers investigating how much animals are responsible for mixing water between layers in the ocean.\nThe final episode promoted colonizing \"inner space\". It was focused on the view that ocean explorations/colonies make more sense than going to Mars. I'm in favour of both, so I don't see why it needs to be a competition. Ballard thinks we need to turn to the ocean to feed the world: he highlighted modern offshore aquaculture (Kona Kampachi) and long-standing Chinese techniques that are still in use. Late in the episode it gets into the concept of seasteading by showing a project in Galveston to refurbish an oil rig as a 300-person habitation in the Gulf of Mexico.\nAlien Deep doesn't have as polished cinematography as the BBC nature documentaries I refer to above or as Earth: A New Wild, but it gives a glimpse behind the scenes of how underwater research is done so it is worth watching if the subject interests you. Plus the enthusiasm of Dr. Ballard is contagious.\nThe last documentary I'll discuss here is completely different from the ones I've mentioned above. Banking on Bitcoin tells the story of the origin and early years of the first successful cryptocurrency . The movie was released early in 2017, so it is fairly up-to-date (although things moved very quickly for Bitcoin toward the end of last year).\nHere is the trailer; the complete movie is 1h23 long and is currently available on Netflix:\nAfter a discussion about what money is (getting the views of school children and a Wall St. Journal reporter), the documentary explains how Bitcoin works: it is based on a shared, open ledger instead of relying on a central bank (i.e. it's distributed rather than centralized). Every transaction is recorded in the \"blockchain\"; \"miners\" verify and update the blockchain. The documentary includes some helpful explanatory animations.\nBanking on Bitcoin made the point that the exchanges (where Bitcoin interfaces with traditional currencies) are the weak link in the system. The infamous case of Mt. Gox was covered. Of course, it is not as if more conventional financial institutions have been immune to fraud and failure. Bitcoin was coincidentally launched shortly after the Lehman Bros. bankruptcy and lots of comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis are drawn in the documentary.\nThe documentary mentioned that 2.5 billion adults around the world don't have access to bank accounts so something like Bitcoin that people can just put on a cellphone could help fill that gap. In that regard, remittance payments that are more accessible compared to using companies like Western Union could be an important role for Bitcoin. However, as the documentary points out, Western Union can process two orders of magnitude more transactions per second than Bitcoin (and Visa dwarfs Western Union).\n(I looked up their respective market capitalizations and found that at current prices Western Union is around $10 billion USD, Visa is around $270 billion USD, and Bitcoin is around $255 billion USD—though keep in mind that stocks vs. currency isn't an apples-to-apples comparison).\nThe best part of the documentary is probably its recounting of the history of Bitcoin. The story is told by interviewing people who have been heavily involved, as well as journalists who have been following it (such as Nathaniel Popper of the New York Times). Banking on Bitcoin effectively shows how its early years were really a wild west, with all the risk and potential reward that entails. The potential of Bitcoin attracted a very disparate cast of characters:\nThe most intriguing character involved with Bitcoin is its founder/inventor Satoshi Nakamato. Banking on Bitcoin explores some possible identities for this individual (or team) but there are no conclusive answers, which adds a lot of mystique to Bitcoin's origins.\nOverall I thought this was a great documentary. It is fascinating and paced just right.\nIn addition to watching this documentary, I've done some further reading about Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies recently:\nOver the holidays I also got into an old computer game, which I'm planning to write about next week.\nPermalink",

It's also an opportunity to provide a convenient annual archive so readers can click on interesting links they may have missed.\n2017 was Canada's sesquicentennial; some of my highlights from the year involved enjoying my own country by visiting national—and local—parks (Kejimkujik, Fundy, and Kouchibouguac) along with some museums and galleries.\nEarly in the year, I had the opportunity to travel to Brazil for my job, which was a great experience. Here's another post that relates to my professional life.\nI read around 20 books this year. I reviewed 8 on my blog (most of the rest were novels), including: The Sea: A Cultural History, Quantified, Seasteading, and Every Good Endeavor.\nFor 2018, I already have a lengthy list of books I'd like to read. I'd also like to take an international trip for vacation (still to be determined). Closer to home, I'd like to explore some out-of-the-way corners of NB (e.g. Mt. Carleton, Deer Island, and Lameque). Of course, I also want to keep kayaking and hiking and probably get to a national park or two (even though admission won't be free next year). If anyone else is planning to visit my neck of the woods, this post may be a useful guide.\nHere is the complete list of posts from this year (previous years: 2014, 2015, 2016):\nTo wrap up, I have a few random notes to share:\nPermalink",

    "description": "This is my final post for the year (not counting a year in review summary\nplanned for a week from now) and it is a book review I've been saving for\nChristmas. The book is Every Good Endeavor: Connecting your work to God's work \nby Tim Keller [http://www.timothykeller.",
    "content": "This is my final post for the year (not counting a year in review summary planned for a week from now) and it is a book review I've been saving for Christmas. The book is Every Good Endeavor: Connecting your work to God's work by Tim Keller.\nTim Keller is a pastor in New York and has written a number of books. I've read at least a couple of his other works (Generous Justice and Counterfeit Gods) and appreciated them, so that motivated me to read this one. Every Good Endeavor is aimed at men and women working in secular jobs. It discusses how a lot of pastors don't always know how to speak relevantly to people in such roles, so Keller is trying to fill a gap with this book. Personally, I found it to be a very worthwhile read.\nEvery Good Endeavor is divided into three sections, each with several chapters. The first section is about the way work should be, in a healthy world. The second section is about ways in which work goes wrong. The third section is about getting back to wholeness. Each chapter draws on a passage or two of scripture, along with literary references, and examples from the lives and careers of people Keller knows.\nThe most moving literary reference was to Tolkien's short story \"Leaf by Niggle\" about a painter that is inspired to paint a great tree, but keeps getting interrupted to help his neighbours and only ever finishes painting a single leaf (I haven't read the original yet, so I'm relying on Keller's re-telling here). In heaven, he's assured that his leaf was not a waste, because \"there really is a tree\" (hence the title of this post) and his inspiration had flown from \"a vision of the True\". Here is what Keller writes to draw out the meaning of this story:\nBut really—everyone is Niggle. Everyone imagines accomplishing things, and everyone finds him- or herself largely incapable of producing them. Everyone wants to be successful rather than forgotten, and everyone wants to make a difference in life. But that is beyond the control of any of us. If this life is all there is, then everything will eventually burn up in the death of the sun and no one will even be around to remember anything that has ever happened. Everyone will be forgotten, nothing we do will make any difference, and all good endeavors, even the best, will come to naught. Unless there is God. ...\nThere is a God, there is a future healed world that he will bring about, and your work is showing it (in part) to others. Your work will be only partially successful, on your best days, in bringing that world about. But inevitably the whole tree that you seek—the beauty, harmony, justice, comfort, joy, and community—will come to fruition. If you know all this, you won’t be despondent because you can get only a leaf or two out in this life.\nOne of the major themes of Every Good Endeavor is the dignity and importance of work. Biblically, work is not a curse/punishment:\nWork did not come in after a golden age of leisure. It was part of God’s perfect design for human life, because we were made in God’s image, and part of his glory and happiness is that he works, as does the Son of God, who said, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working” (John 5:17).\nAnd physical work shouldn't be looked down on as being less than mental or spiritual work:\nIndeed, the biblical doctrine of creation harmonizes with the doctrine of the incarnation (in which God takes upon himself a human body) and of the resurrection (in which God redeems not just the soul but the body) to show how deeply “pro-physical” Christianity is.\nOur work, which should be done with diligence and competence, can be a means of provision for others:\nLuther says that “when you pray for ‘daily bread’ you are praying for everything that contributes to your having and enjoying your daily bread. . . . You must open up and expand your thinking, so that it reaches not only as far as the flour bin and baking oven but also out over the broad fields, the farmlands, and the entire country that produces, processes, and conveys to us our daily bread and all kinds of nourishment.” So how does God “feed every living thing” (Psalm 145:16) today? Isn’t it through the farmer, the baker, the retailer, the website programmer, the truck driver, and all who contribute to bring us food?\nKeller cites a wide variety of Biblical examples in Every Good Endeavor. I liked this comparison of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther showing how three individuals with different skills and backgrounds worked in unique ways toward a common purpose:\nGod shows the diversity of the people he uses by giving us three different books in the Bible describing how he restores the nation of Israel back to its homeland. First, the book of Ezra is about a minister, a teacher of the word. The Jews needed to be reacquainted with the Bible so their lives could be shaped by what God said. Second, the book of Nehemiah is about an urban planner and developer who used his management skills to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and reinstate stability so that economic and civic life could begin to flourish again. Last, the book of Esther is about a woman with power in the civil government working against racial injustice. Here you have male and female, lay and clergy.\nTim Keller writes a lot about avoiding the trap of making a good thing (e.g. profit, as in the following excerpt) into the most important thing. This is another key theme of of Every Good Endeavor:\nBut remember that an idol is a good thing that we make into an ultimate thing. Corporate profits and influence, stewarded wisely, are a healthy means to a good end: They are vital to creating new products to serve customers, giving an adequate return to investors for the use of their money, and paying employees well for their work. Similarly, individual compensation is an appropriate reward for one’s contributions and is necessary to provide for oneself and one’s family. But it is not our identity, our salvation, or even our source of security and comfort.\nProfit, achievement, etc. are fine motivations as long as they are kept in their place, but love should take precedence:\nLove, then, occupies a supreme place in the Christian imagination. As Jesus says, to be fully human boils down to loving God and loving our neighbor. Everything else—our accomplishments, our causes, our identity, and our feelings—is a distant second. Of course this understanding of the nature of reality will have an extensive impact on how we do our work. For instance, are relationships a means to the end of accruing power, wealth, and comfort? Or is wealth creation a means to serve the end goal of loving others? One way goes against the grain of the universe made by a triune God, and therefore it cannot honor him or lead to human flourishing. The other is the paradigm of Christian work.\nAs an aside, this book had a good run-down of St. Thomas Aquinas' list of cardinal and theological virtues (prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude; faith, hope, and charitable love). All of these virtues, not just love in isolation, should inform the way we live and work.\nIn the final chapter, Keller talks a lot about \"the work under the work\"—motivations for doing our jobs that can become a heavy burden:\nMany people are trying to get a sense of self through productivity and success—but that burns them out. For others the motivation is to bring home a paycheck so they can enjoy “real life”—but that makes work into a pointless grind. These motivations are what we could call the “work beneath the work.” And they are what make work so physically and emotionally exhausting in the end.\nAll of us are haunted by the work under the work—that need to prove and save ourselves, to gain a sense of worth and identity. But if we can experience gospel-rest in our hearts, if we can be free from the need to earn our salvation through our work, we will have a deep reservoir of refreshment that continually rejuvenates us, restores our perspective, and renews our passion.\nIn contrast to \"the work under the work\", he also writes about \"the rest under the rest\" with a deep perspective on the Sabbath:\nGod portrays the Sabbath day as a reenactment of emancipation from slavery. It reminds us how he delivered his people from a condition in which they were not human beings, but simply units of capacity in Pharaoh’s brick production system. Anyone who cannot obey God’s command to observe the Sabbath is a slave, even a self-imposed one.\nThe conclusion of the last chapter is very fitting for Christmas time:\nYou can work with passion and rest, knowing that ultimately the deepest desires of your heart—including your specific aspirations for your earthly work—will be fulfilled when you reach your true country, the new heavens and new earth. So in any time and place you can work with joy, satisfaction, and no regrets. You, too, can say, “Nunc dimittis.”\nIf you're looking for encouragement in your work, I'd really recommend reading this book.\nTo wrap up this post, I wanted to share a song I found that I think goes really well with the themes of Every Good Endeavor:\nMerry Christmas to all my readers!\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post contains reviews of a couple of history books that I read this fall: Salt and Thirst. The former is about salt as an ingredient, preservative, and commodity; the latter is about approaches to water management in various ancient societies.\nSalt: A World History by Mark Kurlansky looks at the history of obtaining, trading, and using salt around the world (it focuses on one region and one era at a time—some regions come up for discussion in more than one era—and the regions considered come from four different continents). It reveals just how important the simple substance was prior to modern means of food preservation. Here are some things that stood out to me from Salt (plus other ideas and random links that the reading inspired):\nSalt is so common, so easy to obtain, and so inexpensive that we have forgotten that from the beginning of civilization until about 100 years ago, salt was one of the most sought-after commodities in human history.\nThe salt trade across the Sahara desert was historically important. Camel caravans would stock up at salt mines like Taoudenni and Taghaza.\nThe city of Sfax is mentioned in an early chapter while discussing early Mediterranean salt production; in one of the final chapters it is mentioned again since there is now a big modern saltworks. It's interesting how some of the choices the Phoenicians and Romans made on where to obtain salt have proved so enduring:\nAbout 800 B.C., when the Phoenicians first settled on the coast of what is today Tunisia, they founded a seaport, Sfax, which still prospers today. Sfax became, and has remained, a source of salt and salted fish for Mediterranean trade. ...\nInland from the port of Sfax are dried desert lake beds where salt can be scraped up in the dry season. This technique, the same as was used 8,000 years ago on Lake Yuncheng in China, and referred to as “dragging and gathering,” was the original Egyptian way of salt gathering, the method used for harvesting natron in the wadi of Natrun. The Arabs called such a saltworks a sebkha, and on a modern map of North Africa, from the Egyptian-Libyan border to the Algerian-Moroccan line, from Sabkaht Shunayn to Sebkha de Tindouf, sebkhas are still clearly labeled.\nThe Romans, finding them less mysterious, called them Galli or Gauls, also coming from a Greek word, used by Egyptians as well, hal, meaning “salt.” They were the salt people. The name of the town that sits on an East German salt bed, Halle, like the Austrian towns of Hallein, Swäbisch Hall, and Hallstatt, has the same root as do both Galicia in northern Spain and Galicia in southern Poland, where the town of Halych is found. All these places were named for Celtic saltworks.\nIn Parma, the production of cheese, ham, butter, salt, and wheat evolved into a perfect symbiotic relationship. ...\nHeating the mixed milk, they added rennet and a bucket of whey, the leftover liquid after the milk curdled in the cheese making the day before. They then heated the new mixture to a higher temperature, still well below boiling, and left it to rest for forty minutes. At this point the milk had curdled, leaving an almost clear, protein-rich liquid, and this whey was fed to pigs. It became a requirement of prosciutto di Parma that it be made from pigs that had been fed the whey from Parmesan cheese.\nKurlansky's book has lots to say about various foods that require salt, including sharing medieval recipes. Pickling is a preservation process that relies on salt and it has been applied to many different foods in various cultures. Sichuan in China is a salt-producing region, and Sichuan cuisine features a lot of pickled vegetables and salty pastes/sauces, for example.\nSalt also goes into the history of Tabasco sauce.\nThe salt shortage of the northern fisheries was solved by a commercial group that organized both herring and salt trades. Between 1250 and 1350, a grouping of small associations in northern German cities formed. Known as the Hanseatic League, from the Middle High German word Hanse, meaning “fellowship,” these associations pooled their resources to form more powerful groups to act in their commercial interests. They stopped piracy in the Baltic, initiated quality control on traded items, established commercial laws, provided reliable nautical charts, and built lighthouses and other aids to navigation.\nWith the once precious salt crystals so common they are dumped onto roads, today there is a scarcity of tuna, anchovies, herring, Great Lakes carp, Caspian caviar, even cod.\nThe long practiced principle of evaporating brine was that when brine becomes supersaturated—when it is at least 26 percent salt, which is considerably more than the 2.5 or 3 percent salt of seawater—sodium chloride crystalizes and falls out, or precipitates, from the liquid. But slowly it was discovered that after the sodium chloride, the salt of primary interest, precipitates, a variety of other salts crystalize at even denser saturation.\nBecause a profitable salt shipment is bulky and heavy, accessible transportation has always been the essential ingredient in salt trade.\nSalt became less important for preserving food with the invention of canning and pasteurizing and fast-freezing (Birdseye method), but some pickled/salt-cured foods are still very popular (although often made less salty than they were in the past).\nBecause it was so essential, many governments in the past exercised monopolies over salt as a source of revenue. In the book, Kurlansky discusses the impact of these laws in France, China, and British-ruled India.\nEarlier this year, I read another book that delved into a single commodity: Uncommon Grounds (about coffee). If this review piqued your interest, you might want to check out that one as well.\nThirst: Water and Power in the Ancient World by Steven Mithen is well-researched and heavily foot-noted—I'd say it's on the border of popular and scholarly works. Like Salt, it draws examples from four continents (South America instead of Africa in this case; Asia, Europe, and North America are featured in both). Here are some of the things I found notable from Thirst:\nFollowing an introduction, the book starts in the neolithic era (which is where much of the author's own research has been focused). One of the things I really appreciated about Thirst is that each chapter includes a map of the sites discussed.\nCrete and Mycenaea had some impressive early examples of sanitation and drainage—which can be as important as water supply. Mycenaeans and later Greeks appear to have been some of the first to get into diverting rivers and reclaiming land.\nRoman aqueducts are probably the most familiar image of ancient water infrastructure. One thing I learned from the chapter on Rome was that there is a surviving report from a Roman water commissioner in 96 A.D.\nThe chapter on China had a lot of familiar content from another book I've read (indeed, it cites Water: The Epic Struggle) such as the story of Yu. Some new things I learned about were the irrigation works at Dujiangyan by Li Bing and modern efforts to conserve the Yellow River that were awarded the Lee Kuan Yew water prize.\nThe decline of Mayan city-states has often been linked to drought. Thirst discusses the environmental archaeology of Richardson Gill who correlated periods of drought with the timeline for decline. The author discusses how the lack of water could have eroded the ritual authority of Mayan lords.\nThe final case study in Thirst is of the Incas. Their famous ruins at Machu Picchu are still standing after six centuries because of the care they took with providing good drainage. There and elsewhere (e.g. Tipón) they constructed terraces for agriculture; after putting in drain tiles they moved fertile soil to the terraces (which must have been a lot of work in the mountainous terrain). The Incas were also attuned to the aesthetics of water (flowing in fountains or cascades—so more similar to Rome or Petra than the mirror-like expanses of Angkor). Mithen mentions an engineer named Wright who became interested in paleo-hydrology and did a lot of research in Peru\nHas controlling water always been a pathway to power, or perhaps even the predominant route? If so, what form has this taken? Was water the cause of conflict in the past between competing city-states or was it a medium for cooperation and mutual growth? Archaeologists have previously addressed such questions. Karl Wittfogel’s 1957 volume entitled Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power argued that ancient civilisations were dependent upon large-scale irrigation works. He proposed the ‘hydraulic hypothesis’ that such works required forced labour and a large bureaucracy, both of which were features of ‘despotic rule’.\nThe scale of such hydraulic engineering implies a considerable degree of centralised planning and control. The reservoirs, dams and canal systems had required vast quantities of building material, labour and time to complete. ...\nIt does appear, however, that contra the 1957 arguments from Karl Wittfogel no such centralised control was necessary for the initial development of irrigation systems ...\n[R]elatively small communities appear to have worked cooperatively in the planning, construction and maintenance of irrigation systems without any overarching authority. Strikingly similar developments happened around the world in ignorance of each other and at quite different times throughout the last 4,500 years. Similar developments most likely happened in many other regions, notably in the Yellow River valley of China; my guess is that they also occurred in locations we were unable to visit within this book, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia. ...\n[I]t appears to have been the canal systems that enabled particular communities, families or individuals to develop a power base, ...\nSo we have a [bootstrapping] process: hydraulic-engineering projects enabled certain families/individuals to secure a power base. With their new authority, they were able to control labour and materials to extend the scale of the hydraulic engineering and so on, ...\nPower lay in controlling access to water.\n(as the ellipses show, I've condensed the text above, but I think I've preserved the flow of the argument).\nThose who built the canals in the Yellow River Valley of China, the Salt River Basin of Arizona, in the rainforests around Edzná and Angkor, and on the Tigris–Euphrates alluvial plain did so thousands of years apart, with no knowledge of each other and within completely different cultures. But they all shared similar ideas, plans and physical labours; they addressed the same questions about gradients and where to place head-gates; they found the same solutions imposed by the common properties of water and then engaged in the same fights against the accumulation of silt and protection against floods.\nSo if you wish to appreciate the Nabataean achievement when visiting Petra, ensure that you pay attention to the discreetly hidden water channels and drains as well as the ostentatious rock-cut tombs. When in Rome, leave the city and go to the Parco degli Acquedotti and if in Arizona search out the Hohokam equivalent at the Park of the Canals in Phoenix. Similarly, when in Constantinople, don’t just visit the Hagia Sophia but also enjoy the Basilica Cistern and Aetius reservoir; if you really wish to appreciate the Byzantine achievement take a trip to the Kurşunlugerme\nI am not sure whether it is with regret or pleasure that I now must inform you that the more I have seen and read, the thirstier I have become; the more that I have learned about the past the more I need to know. I now feel compelled to explore those civilisations not covered within this book, to visit many more archaeological sites around the world and continue with my own excavations in Wadi Faynan. While I hope you have learned something about the past from the pages of my book, I also hope that your thirst has remained equally unquenched.\n*I recently got an e-book called Designed for Dry Feet about land reclamation and flood control works in the Netherlands so I do have something to read in that direction.\nAnother book I read recently was the novel Artemis by Andy Weir (author of The Martian). I don't plan to write a full review—I'll just note that I read it cover-to-cover in a single day—but I do want to draw attention to this interview. In it, Weir talks about the moon colony setting that he developped for Artemis, including creative details like the currency they use and the flag that they're under. (The conversation contains mild spoilers but mainly about the setting rather than the plot).\nPermalink",

    "content": "We're approaching the end of another year so it is time to start looking back at 2017. One of my goals for this year (since it is Canada's sesquicentennial anniversary) was to visit a few National Parks. I also had the privilege of spending time in a bunch of great local parks.\nI was able to visit three National Parks this year:\nFollow the links for photos and descriptions. All of those parks are in the Maritimes; I was in the area of a couple of National Parks in Ontario (1000 Islands and Point Pelee) but it didn't work out to visit—hopefully sometime in the future. I'd also like to get back to the Cape Breton Highlands National Park since it has been several years since I was there (while I've been to the other 4 National Parks in the Maritimes in the past 15 months).\nHere in the Maritimes, however, you often don't even need to leave a city to be in nature and do a nice hike or two. A lot of the cities have good-sized parks within their limits. Here are the ones I went to this year, with their size in hectares (1 ha ≈ 2.5 ac) and links to more information:\n*Halifax has no shortage of other parks (e.g. Shubie (164 ha) and Hemlock Ravine (94 ha)) and trails (e.g. Salt Marsh and Chain of Lakes/B.L.T.) that I'd like to check out. Not to mention a 400 hectare island.\nI also spent the large part of a day hiking around Fanshawe Park (1200 ha) in London, Ontario this summer. All of these parks are wonderful assets for their communities. My top recommendation for visitors would probably be the Irving Nature Park in Saint John since it shows off some unique coastal scenery (while being less than a 15 minute drive from the heart of Uptown).\nElsewhere in the Maritimes, Moncton has a large park (Irishtown – 980 ha) and there also appear to be nice parks in St. Stephen, Miramichi, and Lamèque. I haven't been to any of these ones, but I'll keep them in mind and try to check them out next time I'm nearby.\nA picture is worth a thousand words, and that is especially true when talking about hiking in parks. Here are some photos from the local parks I visited in the Maritimes this year, sorted by season to show that they can be enjoyed year round.\nOdell Park is a nice place to go snowshoeing:\nThe cranes of the container port in Halifax can be seen from some of the paths and trails of Point Pleasant Park:\nThe centrepiece of Victoria Park in Truro is its waterfalls:\nBirch trees flank a boardwalk through a wetland in the Sackville Waterfowl Park:\nThe Lily Lake Pavilion in Rockwood Park:\nOn the subject of parks, there are local and national parks under development in Toronto that are quite interesting projects.\nFor the remainder of 2017 on this blog, I plan to post reviews of a few more books I read this year, then start looking forward to 2018.\nPermalink",

    "content": "At the end of last week, I had a business meeting in the Ottawa area. I decided to stay for the weekend since it was a good opportunity to visit our nation's capital during Canada's 150th anniversary.\nOn Saturday, I went to three museums: Canadian Museum of Nature, National Gallery of Canada, and Canadian Museum of History. I got the museums passport, which covers admission to three museums (from a choice of seven*) over three days—so you can take more time on each visit than I did if you're visiting Ottawa for a longer period.\n*The other four are Agriculture & Food, Aviation & Space, Science & Technology, and the Canadian War Museum. (Additional museums in Ottawa not covered by the passport include the Bank of Canada museum, the \"Diefenbunker\", and the Bytown Museum).\nIf I was making a top 5 list of museums in Ottawa, the three that I visited on this trip would definitely be on it, along with the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum and probably either the War or Science & Technology Museum (although there are quite a few of the remainder that I've never visited).\nBefore I get into discussing the museums I visited on this trip, I'll just mention that I had a great time wandering around Ottawa and trying a few restaurants and cafés (mainly in the Byward Market area). My hotel was in Gatineau, so I got plenty of exercise walking back and forth across the Alexandra Bridge.\nThe location of Ottawa carries a lot of historical significance. It is where the Rideau River meets the Ottawa River. Voyageurs travelling from Montreal deep into the interior of the continent often travelled up the Ottawa River then portaged to the French River to get to the Great Lakes. Later, the construction of the Rideau Canal (a UNESCO site) in the 1820s also provided a route from Montreal to the Great Lakes.\nThe first museum I went to was the Museum of Nature. It's housed in a Victorian edifice with some contemporary modifications. Because I wanted to get to multiple museums that day, I decided to select a few of the galleries of the Nature museum instead of trying to tour the entire place. The ones I went to were on the Arctic, water habitats, and mammals.\nHere are some Arctic foxes and lemmings that were in the Arctic gallery:\nThe Arctic foxes were smaller than I was expecting (i.e. smaller than other foxes I've seen). This was also true of the caribou and muskox specimens that were in the Arctic gallery. I'm not sure if there is a general trend of Arctic animals being smaller than related species in more southerly locales or if it was just those particular individuals in the museum's collection—the polar bear certainly was not!\nThe Arctic gallery also paid a lot of attention to the culture and lifestyle of the people that live there. It had an interesting chart on how Inuit people classify plants and animals (\"uumajuit\"; interestingly, dogs are excluded from the main category of animals due to their close association with people).\nThe Water gallery had a blue whale skeleton (see the photo below) as its centrepiece. It also had a timely display on the C3 Expedition, including a big map on the floor of its route around Canada.\nThe Mammal gallery was really well presented. It included nice dioramas of the most popular Canadian animals along with some good scientific education; some examples were a breakdown of the fat/protein/sugar content in the milk from different mammals, an interactive body-heat camera (to demonstrate that humans are warm-blooded), a display case of different members of the mustelid family, and comparisons of different types of horns/antlers.\nThe next museum I went to was the National Gallery of Canada. There I spent the most time in the wing focusing on Canadian (including Indigenous) art pre-1967. From meanders through other sections of the National Gallery, I'm pretty confident in stating that that is the best wing to see. The collection has enough works from important movements and artists in Canadian history to trace the development of art in this country (which is not so much the case in their European and American art wing). They had a few good pieces on display from Cornelius Krieghoff and a really great collection of works by Lawren Harris (and other members of the Group of Seven).\nIn this collage, you can see (clockwise from top left) a couple of paintings by Krieghoff, a work by Harris, and an Algonquin birchbark canoe in front of some Group of Seven works (the two in the middle are \"Fire-Swept, Algoma\" and \"The Solemn Land, 1921\"):\nOn the topic of canoes, they had a painting by Frances Anne Hopkins of a voyageur canoe shooting some rapids.\nA great temporary exhibit at the National Gallery was on James Wilson Morrice. He lived around the turn of the century and was very widely travelled—to Europe, North Africa, and the Caribbean. I wasn't familiar with him before seeing this exhibit but I like his work.\nOut of the contemporary art I saw, I liked these works the best: some whale skeletons made from disassembled plastic lawn chairs by Brian Jungen (with the real whale skeleton from the Nature Museum pasted into the same image for comparison):\nThe third museum I went to was the Canadian Museum of History. It used to be the Museum of Civilization but had a slight change in focus and a name change recently. I think there is a need for a Canadian history museum in Ottawa; if we don't tell our story as a nation, who will? This museum is packed with information, so you could spend all day there if you wanted to be thorough. I opted to wander through at a pace that would let me reach the end by closing time (it was already mid-afternoon by the time I got there) and just focus on the displays that seemed the most interesting.\nMost of the lower level was dedicated to First Nations history. The museum is well known for its collection of totem poles, but I was most interested by a section that delved into the different ways of life that pre-contact aboriginal communities had in different regions of the country. The First Nations around the Great Lakes, for example, had the most agriculture, along with settlements defended by palisades. On the prairies, hunting involved large groups working together to herd buffalo off of cliffs (further north, communal hunts of caribou took place). In the Arctic, whale hunting was the mainstay of communities. Being from New Brunswick, I was especially interested in the display about the Mi'kmaq, which included a calendar showing annual movements between summer villages (on the coast for fishing) and winter hunting camps (when small family groups would withdraw to the woods).\nThe upper levels (I skipped a temporary exhibit on the main level) comprise the Canadian History Hall. It is divided into three sections: before the British conquest of Québec (covering additional history of First Nations, plus the Nouvelle France era), the development of Canada as a British colony (then post-Confederation) over the next century and a half, and finally the Twentieth Century.\nThe museum had some really significant artifacts on display, such as the Bluenose sail plan, General Wolfe's field cloak, and wampum belts for various treaties. They were also making good use of 3D printing to have models or replicas of some items that kids (and hands-on adults) could touch.\nAn interesting thing that I learned about Champlain was that he had been on a voyage to the Spanish Caribbean colonies in 1599 and wanted to take a more diplomatic approach to the existing inhabitants on his own explorations in Canada.\nI also learned more than I knew before about the struggles between the Métis and the Hudson Bay Company. Both groups were heavily involved in the fur trade.\nThe final, modern, section of the History Hall put too much emphasis on politics and social movements, in my opinion. It had a little bit about sports and the arts, but didn't have much coverage of 20th-C. Canadian accomplishments in industry, business, technology, infrastructure, etc. I don't think it would be too hard for the museum to find content to at least touch on some of these sectors. For example, this blog post lists having good banks as a good reason for Canadian patriotism; as a civil engineer, projects like the Confederation Bridge come to mind for me.\nAll in all, going to these museums was a great way to spend a day in Ottawa. They each have really good collections that are presented effectively. And the buildings they're in all have unique architecture.\nPermalink",

Rivers, maps, and fractals are some of my favourite things, so I really like how it has some fractal characteristics (here's another art print I got from Etsy that has some fractal characteristics).\nMajor rivers visible on the map include: Ebro, Rhone, Po, Rhine, Elbe, Danube, and Dnieper. The European watershed separates drainage basins depending on which side of the Gibraltar Strait they enter the ocean or sea. There are a couple of important canals that allow boats to navigate across this watershed.\nThe artist that made this map, EarthArtAustralia, has many others available, both for different countries and continents, and for features other than rivers (each map has only one feature, though). Here are some examples for Canada—the forest and road ones are really revealing.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post comprises a board game review and an interactive map I made, joined by the common theme of non-traditional storytelling.\nRogues to Riches is a story-telling board game, created by Sam Fraser in Halifax. I backed it on Kickstarter a few years ago, but only got the print-and-play version; I didn't get around to playing it until I was in a board game cafe (in Halifax, as it turns out) this summer and played it with some friends. After that, I was motivated to print, cut, and glue the digital copy I had so that I could play it at home.\nIn the game, each player has a \"lair\" that they are trying to defend, while on their turn they have to pick another lair to attempt to rob. Each lair is defended by a series of \"traps\" (described on one deck of cards) which the would-be robber has to use their \"gear\" (described on another deck of cards) to overcome. The game mechanics involve the thief explaining to other players how they plan to get past a trap using their gear, followed by the defender explaining how the trap will foil the scheme. The observing players get to vote (one or two thumbs up or down) on the viability of the plan and then the number of votes is added/subtracted to a dice roll. The plan succeeds if the total is above a certain threshold.\nMy best moment so far while playing Rogues to Riches was using a Top Hat gear card to overcome a Fog of Apathy trap by explaining that the self-respect it bestowed would surmount a lack of motivation induced by the fog. In the following photo, I've moved the defeated Trap card into the points section of my lair (you get points by defeating traps and stealing riches).\nHere is another board game from Kickstarter that I reviewed earlier this year.\nSwitching gears completely, I've previously noted the story-telling potential of Google Earth—and the latest version has embraced that aspect. I decided that I wanted to try making a story in Google Earth myself. The topic I selected was a biography of John Wesley (the Wikipedia article was my main reference).\nThe following photo shows a screenshot looking at the map I made. There are placemarks for significant locations in Wesley's life which each expand to a description (many of which include photos) when clicked. There is also a slider (in the top left of the main frame) that traces a line from one place to the next as the years advance.\nThe file can be downloaded here if you have Google Earth installed and would like to view it interactively.\nI wrote the kml file manually in gedit. The following snippets of code formed the core of the file. The timeline template was expanded to around 25 pairs of <when> and <gx:coord> (with the dates and coordinates filled in) and the location template was copied and pasted around 20 times (then filled in with the coordinates and description). To improve this file, I could have added some <Style>—especially for the timeline track.\nTimeline template:\nLocation template:\nHere are some additional references on Wesley:\nFinally, if you're interested in Church history, I suspect you'll also enjoy this rap video about Martin Luther (1517 was 500 years ago, by the way).\nPermalink",

    "content": "On the heels of my previous post, I wanted to write something else related to the science of wastewater treatment. The two papers I discuss below are ones that I've read in the past, but haven't shared any notes on before.\nThe papers I discuss below are written by a group of researchers from Wageningen University—famous around the world for its agriculture expertise, and also possessing a very strong history of wastewater treatment research. (The Netherlands in general is strong in all sorts of water-related engineering, which is part of the reason it's high on my list of countries I'd like to visit). These two papers are both tightly-focused review papers and both are very well written. They deal with the concept that anaerobic digestion requires a group of microorganisms to play different roles, and, because there is only a small amount of chemical energy available, electrons actually end up getting transferred between species.\nThe following are my notes and excerpts from these two papers:\nAbstract:\nPropionate is a key intermediate in the conversion of complex organic matter under methanogenic conditions. Oxidation of this compound requires obligate syntrophic consortia of acetogenic proton- and bicarbonate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Although H2 acts as an electron-carrier in these consortia, evidence accumulates that formate plays an even more important role. To make energy yield from propionate oxidation energetically feasible for the bacteria and archaea involved, the concentrations of H2 and formate have to be extremely low. On the other hand, the diffusion distance of these carriers has to be small to allow high propionate conversion rates. Accordingly, the high conversion rates observed in methanogenic bioreactors are due to the fact that the propionate-oxidizing bacteria and their methanogenic partners form micro-colonies within the densely packed granules.\nNotes:\nAbstract:\nExocellular electron transfer plays an important role in anaerobic microbial communities that degrade organic matter. Interspecies hydrogen transfer between microorganisms is the driving force for complete biodegradation in methanogenic environments. Many organic compounds are degraded by obligatory syntrophic consortia of proton-reducing acetogenic bacteria and hydrogen-consuming methanogenic archaea. Anaerobic microorganisms that use insoluble electron acceptors for growth, such as iron- and manganese-oxide as well as inert graphite electrodes in microbial fuel cells, also transfer electrons exocellularly. Soluble compounds, like humic substances, quinones, phenazines and riboflavin, can function as exocellular electron mediators enhancing this type of anaerobic respiration. However, direct electron transfer by cell–cell contact is important as well. This review addresses the mechanisms of exocellular electron transfer in anaerobic microbial communities. There are fundamental differences but also similarities between electron transfer to another microorganism or to an insoluble electron acceptor. The physical separation of the electron donor and electron acceptor metabolism allows energy conservation in compounds as methane and hydrogen or as electricity. Furthermore, this separation is essential in the donation or acceptance of electrons in some environmental technological processes, e.g. soil remediation, wastewater purification and corrosion.\nNotes:\nPermalink",

    "content": "At the start of the month, as I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I attended a big wastewater conference in Chicago.\nNote: everything on this blog is solely my own view and is written in my own capacity.\nI was one of over 22,000 people to attend WEFTEC this year; it was my third time at this conference and tradeshow. After arriving and getting set up on Sunday, some coworkers and I went to the Gospel Brunch at the Chicago House of Blues. The next three days were non-stop: talking to people at our booth and perusing the tradeshow floor, attending some technical presentations, and going to networking events in the evening. On Thursday, we had another day of meetings in the lovely town of Geneva outside of Chicago (I started the day with a short 15-min jog along the Fox River). It was a privilege to be able to go.\nBefore I get into some notes on the technical sessions and other observations, I'll share a couple of photos to hopefully give a sense of what it was like to be there.\nThis photo only shows a portion (I'd guess around 10%) of the tradeshow floor, to convey the scale of the WEFTEC conference:\nThe photo, taken from a rooftop lounge, looks across the Chicago River at the Wrigley Building and the Tribune Tower. The architecture in that city truly is impressive:\nA couple of the technical sessions I went to were 202 (\"Optimizing the Nutrient-Resource-Energy Nexus in a Carbon and Energy Constrained World\") and 601 (\"Application of Advanced Biological Treatment Processes to Challenging Industrial Wastewaters\"). The former session was focused on research that is still distant from the application stage (as far as I could tell), while the latter session featured case studies of completed projects.\nHere are some very concise summaries of some of the presentations I saw in Session 202:\nAs I mentioned, the research in this session did not seem like it was close to commercial viability.\nI only had time to see a couple of presentations in session 601, but they were both really well done (disclosure: one of them was given by a co-worker about a project by our company, so I'm probably a bit biased):\nAside from the presentations I saw at the conference, there were several that I didn't have time to attend, but for which I looked up the papers in the proceedings. There are a couple of them that used a biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay. I'm very familiar with applying this assay, so I had a few critiques of how it was presented in those papers:\nBecause of the broad scope of the show (from the stormwater presentation track, to operator challenge events, to university research presentations, to an industrial wastewater mixer) there is something for everyone—everyone who works in the field of wastewater—which means everyone will have a different perspective looking back at the conference. Here are someone else's (who I've never met) notes on WEFTEC 2017.\nA final item that I will discuss is that it's clear at a conference like this that a lot of highly talented professionals in the wastewater treatment industry are getting close to retirement. There will be some big shoes for younger professionals like myself to fill; the breadth of experience that some of these older guys have is irreplaceable in my view.\nIf you enjoyed this post, here are some other things I've written this year that are related to what I do professionally:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This weekend I went to a couple of art exhibits and I decided to share a bit about them below.\nOn Saturday, I went to Saint John for the day. I got lunch at the City Market, wandered around Uptown for a while, visited the New Brunswick Museum, and went for a stroll in Rockwood Park. At the NB Museum, the main thing I wanted to see was a temporary exhibit I had heard about. There are different approaches to visiting museums, ranging from trying to see everything on display in a systematic way to zeroing in on a particular exhibit (I have a vague idea for writing a post along these lines someday). I've seen the permanent exhibits at the NB Museum before, so it made sense to focus on the temporary one this time. \"Conservation on Canvas\" features paintings by Michael McEwing from over thirty different preserves owned by the NB Nature Trust.\nThe Nature Trust properties are spread around the province—albeit with the greatest number clustered in the south-west—and the paintings span the four seasons, so this art really captures the diversity of natural scenery in New Brunswick.\nThe following paintings (they were spread out in the exhibit, so I pasted some photos that I took together) are of four NB Nature Trust preserves in the Fredericton area:\nClockwise from top left, this shows the paintings from the James C. Yerxa, Sugar Island, Hyla Park, and Burpee Bar preserves.\nI think this sample of the exhibit gives a good sense of the style and talent of Mr. McEwing. Note that these images belong to the artist; I've included the compilation above only for the purposes of review and comment. Hopefully it provides motivation to go see the whole exhibit.\nI've been to each of the preserves portrayed in the above paintings and I find them quite true to life. The painting from Sugar Island was one of my favourites from the whole exhibit as it reminds me of kayaking on the Saint John River in the summer. Based on some of the other paintings in this series, I'd also like to visit some other preserves around the province such as Caughey-Taylor, Connor Brothers, and Joseph Allain.\nBefore moving on to discuss the other art event I went to on the weekend, I'll quickly note that land trusts are probably the best-established element of free market environmentalism.\nOn Sunday, there was a long awaited grand opening of the new wing of the Beaverbrook Art Gallery, with a public open house. This event seemed to be really well attended and also very well organized: there were plenty of volunteers, temporary security guards to supplement the regular staff in keeping an eye on the art, a few performances, and even some workshops (I didn't attend any).\nThe new wing/pavilion looks great, so commendations are due to everyone involved in the planning, fundraising, and construction. It adds more display space to the gallery—including a special alcove for the Salvador Dali masterpiece Santiago El Grande (with some other works by Dali and also Alex Colville keeping it company)—as well as space for performances, a studio for an artist-in-residence, a teaching space, and a café. Strategically-placed windows give pleasant views of the river and the Green.\nHere are a couple of photos that I took at the open house, showing a strings concert in one of the galleries and the exterior of the new pavilion:\nSomething I thought was really cool (although I didn't get any) at the open house was that they had a one-day-only sale of limited-edition prints of some really unique works in their collection (e.g. a study of Churchill's hands by Graham Sutherland).\nIn addition to parts of the permanent collection that are on display, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery currently has an exhibit of nature photography by Marlene Creates. She has quite an eye for detail and has done neat series on signs, among other works that are on display.\nSpeaking of Dali's Santiago El Grande, I think I've previously mentioned that the structure in the background was inspired by the roof of a chapel in Toulouse. To mark the occasion of opening its new display alcove, I'm sharing this image where I superimposed the painting (as a semi-transparent layer with cut-outs) over a picture I took in that chapel:\nFinally, here are a couple of links to previous posts in which I've discussed the Beaverbrook Art Gallery.\n#BiggerBetterBeaverbrook\nPermalink",

    "content": "Last week I was in a conference in Chicago. I plan to write about it later this month, but for this week I just wanted to share some miscellaneous links (mostly related to things I've written about previously) that I've been saving up. It's quite rambling but hopefully you find something of interest below.\nI watched the new Blade Runner movie last night. It was ponderously paced, with lots of long shots of Ryan Gosling's face. But in spite of having less action, I think it really captured the same tone and similar themes that made the first Matrix movie such a success. The director was Denis Villeneuve (a Canadian). He wants to do an adaptation of Dune—I love the book, so I hope it happens.\nThis article that I came across recently incorporates three things I like into its title: James Watt, keeping a day of rest, and walking in the park. It also cites a book I reviewed a few years ago.\nAnother article I came across recently is about the sequel to another book I reviewed a few years ago.\nHere is a really interesting essay on whether nation-states will be eclipsed by city-states in the future. An excerpt:\nFleeting around from one city to the next, as I sometimes do, feels more Hanseatic League than League of Nations: a system of powerful, trading, networked cities. And the Hanseatic League itself was hardly an oddity. Before that there was Venice of course, and that was merely the most well-known of many independent city-states dotted across what is now Italy in the 10th to 16th centuries, including Florence, Bologna and Turin. ... Only a few formal city-states still exist today (Monaco, Singapore and the Vatican are the completely sovereign city-states; others, such as Hong Kong, act like one but do not have full sovereignty). It is in fact a historical anomaly that so few of us live in city-states.\nToward the end of the essay, the author mentions seasteading.\nHere are a few random links:\nI've previously shared at least one video from Scott Manley. Here is one where he explains some of the math behind orbits:\nLangfocus is another YouTube channel I've been enjoying recently:\nI'm not sure if I'll get out for anymore fall hikes, but here is a good list of suggestions. It includes a couple from Kouchibouguac.\nNarcity makes me feel very Canadian when I browse it since the main page doesn't segregate French and English posts. Their suggestions for daytrips around Halifax (e.g. visiting Lunenburg) seem pretty solid to me.\nFinally, the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton is opening a new wing this weekend. I hope to go check it out. There is also currently an art exhibit at the NB Museum that I'd like to go see. If I make it, I expect I'll discuss these shows further in a future post.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is an informational .gif that I put together about annual variability in the salinity of the Arctic Ocean (and North Atlantic/Pacific).\nAs I noted in a recent book review, I've read a number of books about the sea this year. This post is an effort to understand more about the way water circulates through the ocean and the science that explains its currents. Thermohaline circulation is the concept that differences in temperature and salinity affect the density of water; differences in density, in turn, act as a driving force for significant currents.\nThe temperature aspect is fairly straightforward, but salinity varies in complex ways both spatially and over the course of a year. The Aquarius satellite monitors the ocean's salinity from space. I took the images (see here for the originals) they had from a one year period (July 2012 – June 2013) and compiled them into the following .gif:\n(purple = 3%, aqua/green = 3.5%, red = 4%, grey = no data (e.g. covered with ice)) Also, to be clear, all of the frames belong to Aquarius; all I did was compile them into the animated .gif above.\nDuring the summer (the first few frames of the .gif), there is a lot of melting in the Arctic. Ice is 100% water, 0% salt, so it dilutes the salinity as it melts (and concentrates it as it freezes*). Additionally, rivers like the Mackenzie and the great rivers of Siberia dump a lot of fresh water into the ocean during the spring freshet and early summer.\n*This is another application of this effect.\nA famous current that is driven by thermohaline circulation is the Gulf Stream. It is clearly visible on Windy.com, a weather visualization website that I learned about from a co-worker (if you click the buttons on the side of the map, you can also see wind, waves, pressure, etc.).\nI mentioned in this book review that seas with a high salinity and narrow opening such as the Mediterranean and Red Sea tend to have strong inward currents at their mouths. Conversely, the Baltic Sea has a low salinity, which also influences the currents at its outlet.\nAside from salinity, I'd like to learn more about eddies and gyres to better understand ocean science. Here are a few links I found for future reading:\nI also thought this would be a good place to share this cute ditty by Lewis Richardson:\nBig whorls have little whorls\nWhich feed on their velocity,\nAnd little whorls have lesser whorls\nAnd so on to viscosity.\nIn the past, understanding oceanic currents (e.g. Benjamin Franklin's research on the Gulf Stream) and winds was very important for marine navigation. Nowadays, it is less of a constraint on marine traffic, but it is definitely still an interesting topic in my opinion.\nIf you liked this post, here's another one you may want to check out.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This weekend I went camping in Kouchibouguac National Park with a friend from the West Coast.\nThis was my 2nd time tenting this summer (well, it was technically the beginning of fall). It was a really fantastic weekend—the warm, clear weather certainly didn't hurt! As a bonus, admission to national parks in Canada is free this year (campsites still have fees).\nThe first night in Kouchibouguac, we went to Fall Star Fest, an event by the NB chapter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC). They had around 10 telescopes (high-quality ones, not like the one I tried to make) set up in a field. Someone had a Cassegrain telescope and there was also at least one with a 16\" aperture. The public could come and look though the telescopes and their owners would explain a bit about what could be seen. Most of the astronomers were pointing their telescopes at various Messier objects; we saw the Ring Nebula (M57) twice, for example. It was a fun event and all of the people from RASC were friendly and willing to share their knowledge.\nEven without telescopes, looking up from our nightly campfires gave a spectacular view.\nThe next day, we were really active. We biked around a loop (27+ km) that covered the central core of the park. After that, we rented a canoe and paddled to Loggiecroft. There is a commercial wharf there, and we were able to buy some fresh lobster to take back to our campsite (cooking them was a challenge, on account of having a small pot and a hard-to-light gas stove). Before sunset, we also walked on the boardwalk out to the Kelly's Beach on the dune/barrier island that stretches along the coast of the Northumberland Strait.\nOne of the cool parts about visiting places with different people is seeing things with fresh eyes. My friend is enthusiastic about mushrooms so we ended up noticing a ton of them in the park this time of year. I took a bunch of photos to make the composite image below.\nKouchibouguac National Park has many short trails. On our last day, we hiked five of them (the total distance was around 6 km), getting a nice sampling of various environments within the park. The Bog and Pines trails were my favourites.\nFinally, before sharing some photos, I'll mention that we stopped to see the Priceville suspension bridge on the drive back to Fredericton.\nHere are some telescopes awaiting dark for the RASC event:\nWe saw a ton of mushrooms along the sides of trails; this is a non-exhaustive gallery of the different types:\nThe foreground is the dock where we rented a canoe and the wharf across the river is where we bought some lobster:\nThe boardwalk to Kelly's Beach, across the lagoon:\nThe Bog trail has a cool lookout tower:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a book review. The title is an allusion to another one I wrote earlier this year.\nSeasteading: How Floating Nations Will Restore the Environment, Enrich the Poor, Cure the Sick, and Liberate Humanity from Politicians was written by Joe Quirk with contributions by Patri Friedman and was published earlier this year. It is kind of a unique style of book because it is basically a pitch for a dream. The dream—which they call seasteading—is to eventually have cities (preferably sovereign city-states) on the ocean. The book discusses some technologies that are converging that could make this dream possible as well as some problems that it could solve. It is divided into four parts. The first part discusses some precedents for living on the water (e.g. cruise ships, floating structures in harbours, and shipping container homes), the second gets into some technologies that could enable permanent life at sea, with lots of sustainability benefits, the third part goes into some possible business plans to make the economies of seasteads work, and the last part addresses common objections and the prospective benefits of getting some distance from politics on land.\nAside from cruises, which see an increasing number of people spend time at sea every year, a lot of the precedents for seasteading that the authors mention come from the Netherlands. Concerns about rising sea levels and a strong tradition of maritime engineering have made floating buildings (like this pavilion in Rotterdam) a bit of a trend. Because standardized, modular units (i.e. shipping containers) are already so familiar to the marine world, plans for floating structures (e.g. from this foundation) are often reconfigurable and plug-and-play. At one point, reading Seasteading made me think of tiny homes due to the shipping container parallel. There are also some very large structures being built at sea in the present time.\nThe section about promising technologies was the highlight of the book for me. They encompassed aquaculture (of fish and seaweed), power generation, and construction techniques. In the chapters of the second section, they talk to fascinating people like Ricardo Radulovich, Neil Sims, and Patrick Takahashi. The big, unifying idea was how aquaculture could tie together some nutrient cycles in ways that would have both economic and environmental benefits:\nInsert seaweed, otherwise known as macroalgae, into the middle of our eight global problems[*], and the entire snafu transforms into a global circle of life. Consider how each of the grand challenges can be solved by the common weed of the sea.\n(*The problems they list are: reducing carbon pollution, cleaning the dead zones, feeding the world, powering civilization, ending poverty in coastal nations, getting healthy, and saving the environment.)\nFor an example of this perspective, one thing they suggest is that cultivating algae in areas like the Gulf of Mexico with lots of fertilizer runoff could take up excess nutrients (and thus have very high yields) that are currently causing ecosystem problems:\nIn our debates about planetary pillage, we keep talking about nutrient “runoff” and water “depletion” and carbon “pollution” and food “waste.” But nothing in nature goes away. It’s merely moved. Phosphorus that once nourished the topsoil of farmland has been drained off and poisons the oceans.\nThey relate this to a neat quote from Buckminster Fuller.\nAs a New Brunswicker, I was happy to see a mention of dulse—although I've never tried eating it smoked like they suggest in the book—and of a researcher at UNB in this section.\nIn addition to aquaculture, another technology that is discussed in Seasteading is OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion). OTEC can generate electricity from temperature differences between surface and deep-ocean waters. It also has potential synergies with aquaculture, since it brings up nutrient-rich cold water to the surface. The authors explain that,\nThe oceans are mostly a barren desert overlying a superabundance of fertilizer that the sunlight never reaches. Most sea life flourishes near land, where the ocean strikes the continental shelf and upwells. When this superabundance of nutrients reaches the sunlight, algae start their photosynthetic engines, becoming the foundation of rich marine ecosystems of life. ...\nTakahashi asks, why are billions of hungry humans relying on natural upwellings covering 0.1 percent of the ocean? Why not create man-made upwellings, each supporting an ocean city?\nIn fact, they discuss ways in which OTEC can benefit each aspect of the water-energy-food nexus (it contributes to \"fresh water, deep-sea fish harvests, surface fish farming, and clean energy\").\nSome other technologies they discuss are Aquapods (which were shown in Earth: A New Wild, I think) and Biorock.\nAfter reviewing technologies that could address the basic resources that would be needed for cities on the ocean, Seasteading considers some businesses that could locate there. One of the key ones they mention is medical tourism. This section was the least interesting to me (in comparison to the rest of the book; I'm not saying it was boring), so I'm not going to say much about it in my review.\nThere is one chapter in the book that is structured as a Q & A where the authors address common objections they've heard. Here is an example of how they come up with a lot of their rebuttals:\nOften when we introduce the seasteading movement to audiences or individuals, we are met with the same cascade of questions. Each is easy to answer if you think like a citizen of the aquatic world, especially if you ask, “Has the cruise ship industry already solved this problem?”\nOne of the philosophical drivers of the dream of Seasteading is that the ability to vote with your feet drives political progress. The end of the book delves into this perspective quite effectively. For example, the authors point out that eras in history with a profusion of jurisdictions have often been very dynamic and innovative (e.g. classical Greece, renaissance Italy, and the westward expansion of the USA). They also discuss how existing small island nations are often more innovative and successful than their neighbours (e.g. Singapore and Mauritius).\nThe world today is full of people who want to leave dysfunctional countries and seek a better life. The authors think that cities on the ocean could help meet this pent-up desire:\nOur long-term plan is to build new city-states for the hundreds of millions of would-be emigrants around the world who are ready to give up on their failed states. After all, it’s the poor who suffer the most from backward governance, not those wealthy enough to rig governments in their favor.\nIf you take away any message from this book, it is this: Seasteading is about emigrant rights. People should be allowed to opt out of governments they didn’t choose. Seastead pioneers don’t need you to vote for them. They only need you to not petition your politicians to stop them.\nOne of their chapters is titled \"Rights Flow from Frontiers\"; they discuss how not only does having a free place to move to help the people who settle there, but it often inspires reforms to eventually trickle back to the places they left:\nIt was realized in America, but the aftereffect is that all countries in Europe went democratic after the founding of the United States. That’s the essence of seasteading. You try experiments in new places, and people in the old world discover, ‘Oh this is pretty good,’ and they adopt it.\nMy main criticism of Seasteading is that the authors are true enthusiasts and the book probably would have benefitted from a skeptical editor (on the other hand, maybe contagious enthusiasm is appropriate for the first book on a topic like this). For example, this sentence made me shake my head a little bit:\nPart of the challenge is breaking down macroalgae so we can reduce it to the methane and the carbon dioxide, but that’s just a biotech challenge. (emphasis added)\nThey also use the portmanteau \"bluetopia\" (semi-?) unironically. However, in spite of the surfeit of enthusiasm, I'd recommend this book. It's worth reading for the descriptions of cutting-edge marine technology alone. I also feel that they're on the right track with the idea that having a new frontier available would bring many benefits.\nI'll conclude this review with a quote from Seasteading that sums up the authors' pitch:\nOver the horizon, new solutions are being generated at increasing speed, and we need to create a forum where they can be tested. The mounting emergencies of sea level rise, peak oil, peak water, peak phosphorus, peak soil, health care costs, poverty, war, and government gridlock aren’t going away while we cling to the status quo. Governments forged in previous centuries are the institutionalization of the status quo. For the sake of the brilliant children being born right now, we must embrace our ignorance, relinquish our desire to control others, and allow innovators to take the plunge.\nSince this book is basically a pitch for a very ambitious dream, as I mentioned in the introduction, my review is just a tiny part of an on-going conversation. Check out some other reviews, from a variety of perspectives, of this book and the idea behind it here.\nFinally, a blog note: Seasteading has been the third book I've read this year about life at sea. It covers potential future possibilities, while the others have considered the history and the experience of seafaring (A couple of years ago, I also read a book on wave dynamics and mechanics). So I guess it has been something of a theme. I also have an upcoming post planned with a connection to the ocean, so stay tuned if this theme interests you.\nPermalink",

    "content": "My apologies for not having any posts for a couple of weeks. Summer is winding down here and I've been trying to make the most of it. This weekend and last weekend, I was at a couple of different spots along the Bay of Fundy coast. Below, I share some of the photos I took.\nTogether with my brother and some other friends, I went camping at Cape Chignecto Provincial Park in Nova Scotia on the last weekend in August. I hadn't been to that part of Nova Scotia before and it was well worth a visit. It is located where the Bay of Fundy forks in two. Its dramatic cliffs face constant erosion from the extreme tides.\nAside from the fun of camping in the park and walking on the beach (and going to the Wild Caraway restaurant), it also made a good base for exploring the surrounding area. Cape d'Or was a really cool place to see. Here is a photo of the lighthouse at Cape d'Or:\nBeyond the lighthouse, you can see the Dory Rips, a zone of turbulence generated by the collision of a few tidal currents at the mouth of the Minas Basin. The next image shows a panorama of these currents:\nHere are some cliffs at Cape d'Or, looking toward Cape Chignecto:\nAnother spot we stopped was Soley Cove. This picture was taken less than 2 hours before high tide, which would rise to the seaweed line visible partway up the rock formation. The tides were coming in fast when we were on this beach.\nOn the first weekend of September, I took a day trip to Fundy National Park to do a hike. It was my second visit to a National Park this year. The trail I chose was Bennett Brook. It's not as popular as some of the other trails in the park—my usual picks are Coastal and Dickson Falls—so even though it was a long weekend, I was able to enjoy some solitude (I passed a few other groups of hikers but most of the time there was no one else in sight).\nThe trail goes from Bennett Lake, where there is a parking lot and a picnic area, to the point where Bennett Brook enters the Wolfe River. Actually, it goes further than that (eventually connecting with the Marven Lake Trail) but that point makes for a logical turn-around if you're not through-hiking.\nThere is a small waterfall on Bennett Brook, just upstream from the confluence with the Wolfe River. I sat there for a while and drank a coffee:\nHere is a view of the Wolfe River and the steep slope up the side of the gorge. Pictures don't capture how strenuous of a climb it is (even with the switchback route the trail takes):\nOn the return trip, I logged the track on my phone. The elevation profile below shows a steep climb for the first 500 metres or so, which was the most challenging part of the trail. Most of the remainder of the trail was a flat or gradually sloped old carriage track. The full round-trip distance was around 11 km.\nAfter my hike, I drove to Point Wolfe (which is where the Wolfe River enters the Bay) and walked out on the beach. I stopped at a look-out point along the way to take this picture. The line of cliffs on the horizon includes Cape Chignecto, I believe (on the right-hand tip):\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a review of a paper reviewing the costs of membrane bioreactor (MBR) and reverse osmosis (RO) technology and how research could positively influence those costs.\n\"Membrane technology costs and me\", by Dr. Simon Judd was published in Water Research in 2017. Before I discuss it, here is the abstract:\nA reflection of the place cost analysis holds in membrane process technology research and development is provided. The review encompassed two membrane processes and applications: (a) reverse osmosis (RO) for seawater desalination, and (b) membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology for wastewater treatment. The cost analysis undertaken extended to (i) the determination of operating expenditure (OPEX) trends using simple analytical expressions, (ii) the subsequent estimation of the sensitivity of OPEX to individual system parameters, and (iii) published data on CAPEX for individual full-scale installations or from cost analyses. An appraisal of the peer-reviewed literature through a survey of a leading scientific database was also carried out. This bibliometric analysis was based on authors’ keywords; it aimed to establish the profile of process cost for each of the two applications when compared with other popular research topics.\nThe OPEX analysis, ostensibly through a consideration of specific energy demand in kWh per m3 permeate, revealed it to relate primarily to hydrodynamics in the case of RO, and to both membrane fouling and air scouring for MBRs. The bibliometric analysis of research trends revealed a marked difference in emphasis on cost aspects between the two research areas, with the focus on cost specifically being 16 times greater for RO desalination of seawater than MBR treatment of wastewater. MBR research appears to be dominated by fouling and foulant characterisation, making up almost a quarter of all studies, notwithstanding evidence from practitioners that other process parameters are as important in determining MBR process OPEX and operability.\nUsing the first person pronoun in the title of the paper is rare, but appropriate for someone who has contributed so much to the literature on water treatment with membrane technology. Dr. Judd is in good company with this personalized article on nitrification by Dr. W. Gujer, for example.\nThe paper starts with a brief overview of the history of membrane technology for water treatment. The introduction also defines operating expenditure (Opex) and capital expenditure (Capex). The purpose of the paper is to \"consider the extent to which the costs of implementing and operating membrane process plants in water and wastewater treatment have been or are likely to be impacted by scientific, technological and commercial development.\" To address this objective, the paper has sections looking at trends in costs of MBR and RO technology, trends in research on these technologies, and a final section on how these trends relate to each other.\nThe trends in costs include both Capex and Opex; however, the author explains that Capex is difficult to analyze since it includes location-specific factors like the cost of land, and is not generally reported or itemized in a standard way. RO is compared to thermal desalination and MBRs are compared to conventional activated sludge (CAS) wastewater treatment systems. For both MBR and RO technology, \"the decline in OPEX since original implementation has been primarily through improved energy efficiency,\" so the Opex analyses focus on energy demand (though other factors such as chemical consumption, membrane replacement, and labour are also mentioned; for more on factors that go into wastewater treatment economics, check out the mindmap that I drew in this post).\nFor RO, sensitivity analysis on energy demand calculations showed that salt concentration and energy recovery (usually done with a turbine on the retentate stream) are important factors. The impact of salt concentration on energy demand implies that mitigating concentration polarization (the author recommends improving hydrodynamics of RO modules but doesn't go into detail) is a promising route for improving Opex.\nCost information for seawater desalination with RO is provided in Table 2. Capex generally appears to be less than $2/L/d of capacity and the cost of water produced is around $0.5/m3 with a couple of exceptions. The specific energy demand is around 4 kWh/m3.\nFor MBRs, sensitivity analysis on energy demand calculations showed that flux and the scour air required per unit area are important factors. Increasing the achievable flux (without shortening the lifespan) decreases the membrane surface area required, which makes replacing membranes less expensive and decreases the overall amount of scour air required. However, increasing flux is difficult since fouling increases exponentially at higher fluxes (see the paper for references on this). In contrast, reducing the scour air required per unit area of membrane surface has been more successful; Dr. Judd notes that, \"Much of the commercial membrane development over the past 15 years has focused on maximising the mixing imparted by membrane air scouring while minimising the amount of air required for this, resulting in significant improvements in energy efficiency\".\nAn example of an improvement in energy efficiency for scouring that wasn't mentioned in this paper but I'm aware of is MemPulse (disclosure: Memcor is another branch of the company I work for now).\nThe section on trends in research on membrane technology is based on bibliometric analysis: summing up the incidence rate of papers in a database containing some relevant keywords. Dr. Judd has a blog post on his website that summarizes the findings, which is useful if you don't have access to the full paper. One key observation was that fouling studies have a high incidence rate among MBR research papers; energy demand, in contrast, did not appear to receive a lot of focus—although he does point out that reducing fouling would facilitate higher fluxes, indirectly improving energy efficiency of MBRs.\nThe final section of \"Membrane technology costs and me\" ties together the trends in research with the trends in costs. The author points out that the published literature on MBRs doesn't necessarily match the highest priority issues faced in real systems. Here are some excerpts:\nIn the case of MBRs a disproportionate amount of research appears to have been dedicated to the study of MBR fouling ([incidence] = 24% on average over the period considered) and its characterisation, especially in comparison to RO seawater desalination for which [incidence] = 10% for fouling studies. The emphasis on characterisation is evidenced by the preponderance of the term EPS (extracellular polymeric substances)... Notwithstanding this large body of research, all practical evidence from full-scale operation suggests that surface fouling is predominantly successfully mitigated by chemical cleaning with a combination of hypochlorite and citric acid (Wang et al., 2014a,b; Judd, 2010; Brepols et al., 2008). Whilst fouling impacts directly on cost (Table 3), it is by no means the only parameter doing so and is not necessarily the most logical system facet to target given that it is determined by the microbiology which, by its nature, is not readily controlled.\nMost crucially, there is a marked difference in emphasis on cost between the two research areas. Whilst cost sensitivity seems to be\nconsidered a valid subject for research in desalination technology, and perhaps other water/wastewater treatment areas (such as algal technologies), this does not seem to be the case for MBRs... Moreover, anecdotal evidence from surveys (Judd, 2016) suggests that issues such as membrane channel clogging, energy demand and, for some sites, foaming feature as prominently as membrane fouling amongst the concerns of MBR practitioner community (in addition to cost). There is no evidence of the incremental improvements in cost effectiveness achieved over the past 25 years being in directly attributable to the considerable scientiﬁc research effort in fouling and its characterisation. In practice, the improved energy efficiencies and decreased membrane costs that have combined to make MBRs more cost competitive appear to have arisen from innovations in engineering design and manufacturing respectively.\n... Whilst much research has been conducted on the science of the two processes and applications considered here, the reality is that actual practical developments that have led to cost reductions owe more to engineering. This dislocation between the research and practitioner communities is hardly a new observation, but is particularly apparent in MBR research where the focus on practically relevant aspects has been less apparent than in the case of RO seawater desalination.\nThis type of research is supposed to be applied (rather than \"blue sky\") so it would probably be beneficial if researchers consulted more with practitioners to ensure that their research can end up being applicable.\nI found this paper by Dr. Judd to be a good read for understanding trends in MBR and RO research, cost, and energy efficiency. I also thought that he has some important things to say about bridging the gap between research and application in the conclusion excerpted above.\nDisclaimer: This is just a reminder that the views expressed in this blog are mine alone; I write it in my own capacity and not as part of my job.\nFinally, I read an article this week about the value of writing in the business world. It reflects some of my own thoughts about why I practice writing a blog and venture into topics related to what I do as a profession sometimes.\nPermalink",

Below are some pictures and a brief description of some of the things that I did.\nWhile in Nova Scotia for the wedding, I had Saturday morning free. National Parks have free admission for Canada's 150th and I was staying less than an hour away from Kejimkujik so I decided to drive there for a [very] quick visit.\nIn Kejimkujik National Park, there is a canoe and kayak rental location at Jake's Landing. I got a kayak and went out on the lake for an hour. I went around an island (Bear Island), saw some waterfowl and aquatic plants, and generally had a relaxing time on the calm waters.\nThe map below is oriented toward the channel between Bear Island and Richie Island. The red and green dots indicate the location of navigation buoys.\nSome of the islands have back-country campsites. In the future I'd love to spend the night on one. There was also a restricted area along the lakeshore containing Mi'kmaq petroglyphs where I think it would be interesting to take the guided tour they offer.\nHere is Jake's Landing, the location of the rental shop:\nIn Ontario, one of the places I went was Grand Bend, on the shores of Lake Huron. The town had a very touristy strip—which was fun in controlled doses—and the beach was quite nice.\nThe sunset over Lake Huron was lovely:\nOther things I did while in Ontario included a hike at Fanshawe Conservation Area, seeing a couple of waterfalls in Hamilton, going in some shops in Stratford, and walking around downtown & harbourfront Toronto.\nI had also wanted to get to Point Pelee National Park but that didn't work out this time.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I wrote an R script for calculating MPN.\nThe Most Probable Number (MPN) method is a long-standing way of calculating the concentration of bacteria in a sample (usually expressed as cells/100 mL). Its distinctive is that it doesn't require a quantitative lab assay; instead, it takes presence/absence results from a series of dilutions and uses statistical techniques to calculate what the most probable number (the name of the method is very literal) of cells was in the original sample given the results observed in the dilution series.\nA typical way of applying this test is to serially dilute the original sample by factors of ten, filling a number (e.g. 5) of tubes from each dilution step. The tubes will have decreasing volumes of the original sample (e.g. 10, 1, and 0.1 mL per tube) along with dilution water and growth media. There will also be a way to detect which tubes have bacteria growing in them such as the production of gas bubbles or chemical byproducts. So each step in the dilution will have a number of tubes with bacteria detected (e.g. 0 – 5 positive results) and a number with no bacteria detected (e.g. 0 – 5 negative results). In order for the MPN method to work, the dilution series must reach a range where a mix of positive and negative results are observed.\nCalculating the MPN directly is difficult to do by hand, since it requires evaluating the probability of the observed results under several possible values for the MPN until the maximum is found. Traditionally, therefore, results were looked up in pre-calculated tables.\nThe direct calculation assumes a poisson distribution:\nP(k) = exp(-λ)(λ^k/k!), where:\nA negative tube has 0 cells and a positive tube has some unknown number greater than 0. The overall probability of a set of positive and negative results is found by multiplying their individual probabilities together.\nThe Metcalf & Eddy Wastewater Engineering textbook gives the following equation for the overall probability (with the notation slightly changed):\ny = (1/a) Πi ([1-exp(-niλ)]^pi) ([exp(-niλ)]^qi), where:\nThe value of λ that maximizes y (or y*a if the constant is dropped) is the MPN. It is replaced with niλ in the above equation to correct for the volume of original sample in each dilution step. The exponents indicate that the probability of a positive or negative tube must be included in the multiplication (for combined probability) the number of times it occurred.\nWith that background explanation, here is the script, MPNCalc.R:\nI compared the results from my script with a table in Standard Methods. The table selects results from three dilutions (out of five) whereas I used all five in my script. In many cases the MPN calculated from my script was close enough to round to the same value as in Standard Methods. However, for some of the examples, the results were vastly different when all five dilutions were used—but became close again if only the three dilutions bolded in the table below were used. Basically, if negative results at a higher dilution were included, a lower number of cells would be implied to be most probable. This illustrates the risk of discarding data points.\nThe table also shows an error for one calculation. I set up the script so that if the numerical solver goes to a negative value for MPN then it quits.\nThere are a few things that could improve the script I wrote. It would be more user-friendly if it took input from an interactive session instead of needing to change the following lines every time:\nAlso, it might work more quickly if it used R's built-in Poisson distribution function—it is a statistics language, after all. Finally, a different numerical method for finding the value of λ that gives the maximum probability might be faster and/or more robust. Initially, I tried to implement a Golden Section Search but couldn't get it quite right.\nBecause the MPN method relies on statistics instead of sophisticated quantitative microbiological assays, it might even be possible to do at home. I'd need to collect a sample (e.g. of river water), make some culture media, perform some dilutions, and then estimate the level of bacteria based on the number of positive and negative tubes. If I do this sometime, I'll likely write about it here.\nPermalink",

    "content": "In recent times, it has been hard to escape noticing the very expensive cost of housing in Toronto and Vancouver (though it seems to be stabilizing for now). I decided to do a little investigation on the cost of housing in New Brunswick for comparison.\nI searched on Kijiji (which is hopefully representative, although it may be weighted more toward private sales) on 8 July 2017. The search was within 150 km of Fredericton (so it includes Moncton, Saint John, Sussex, Woodstock, etc.). I considered houses (not condos) offered for sale. Using the search filtering options, I divided the results into price brackets. Here is an example search for properties < $100,000. I noted the number of results in each price bracket and also selected an example (screenshots below) to present. For each example, I list some characteristics of the property, such as the distance to downtown (taken as the location of City Hall for the respective city, and not factoring traffic delays) and the square footage.\nHere are the numbers of listings that fall into each price bracket:\nThese price brackets do not include the upper end (i.e. the range is < not ≤ the upper value). Note that the brackets get wider as they increase. Some of the listings on Kijiji appeared to be redundant (the same ad uploaded more than once), but I didn't try to correct for that.\nIt can be seen that 85% (3004/3554) of the listings are less than $300,000.\nI selected an example ad from each price bracket defined above to demonstrate what size and features can be obtained for your money. Because ads can change quickly, I'm using screenshots so that this post will continue to make sense. However, these are not my ads, I'm only using them for analysis/comment.\nTo see some New Brunswick houses for sale with prices over $1 million, see this article.\nThe next two ads are for properties that are a bit different from your typical home, but they came up in my search and I wanted to include them in this post.\nPrivate island listings in New Brunswick can also be found here.\nOn a completely different topic, I went hiking on the weekend to Walton Glen Falls and the Eye of the Needle canyon (a previous post I wrote included a video from YouTube of a drone flying over that part of New Brunswick). I'm not going to write a full post about this hike (I didn't take any GPS logs or anything like that), but I did want to share a few photos:\nFrom left to right is the gorge, the falls, and the \"Eye of the Needle\" canyon\nIt is one of the top hikes in the province (at least outside a national or provincial park), in my opinion.\nFor my next post or two, I plan to write about some things that are relevant to what I do professionally, then I expect to have more book reviews and summer adventures to share.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post contains some philosophical and cultural views of water and the sea, including a book review.\nA book (Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power, and Civilization) that I read a few years ago gave the following description of competing perspectives (dikes vs. drainage ditches) on water resource management in ancient China:\nYu took up his father's task by the different approach of laboriously dredging river channels and digging ditches and canals... to divert excess floodwaters to the sea. ... Confucius hailed him as the ideal of the humble, qualified government official who used his power for the public good, and thus the aspiring role model for China's technocratic elite who governed in support of its emperor.\nWater management helped frame the historic Chinese philosophical debate about the right principles for man's governance of himself and his relations to the natural order. The sixth century BC Taoists argued that humble water's yielding, yet relentless flow that wore down all hard and strong obstacles expressed the essence of nature and provided an exemplary model for human conduct. Taoist engineers designed waterworks to allow water to flow away as easily as possible, exploiting the dynamics of the natural ecosystem, just as they urged Chinese leaders to gradually win support for their goals through persuasive dialogue. Their main rivals, the Confucians, on the other hand, advocated a more forceful manipulation of both nature and human society to achieve the public good. They believed rivers had to be forced, through dikes, dams and other obstructive constructions, to do man's bidding as defined by rulers and technocrats. (p.100)\nAnother book I have (Go: More than a game, by Peter Shotwell—which I found in a used bookstore in Portland, Oregon) connects this account of controlling the flood waters to the game of Go:\nThe first attempt—blocking the waters by brute force with the building of a dam—resulted in failure when the dam burst.\nThe second attempt, however, succeeded: a series of drainage ditches were dug in a grid pattern, in much the way a Go board is laid out. (p.134)\nAs an aside, I came across a couple of videos about the game of Go: one about competitive players and one about AI playing it.\nThe Taoist perspective mentioned in the opening excerpt is also seen in quotes like the following from the Tao te ching:\nThe person of higher virtue is like water, benefiting the ten thousand things without struggle. It rests in the lowest places near the Tao.\nBut, with stillness, muddy waters clear. Can you also act while remaining still?\nIn this world there is nothing more yielding than water, yet attack it with strength and you cannot conquer it. In all the world, there is no substitute.\nThe flexible surpasses the inflexible, the soft overcomes the hard. ...\nI don't have quotes about water from the Analects of Confucius for comparison, but I will link to a post I wrote and an essay I found about some of his teachings.\nThe main part of this post will be a review of The Sea: A Cultural History by John Mack. It was suggested by Amazon.ca when I got The Sea and Civilization by Lincoln Paine; it covers a lot of similar historical ground but with quite a different approach. Whereas Paine's book was very detail-oriented (down to giving ship dimensions), chronological, and based on primary sources and archaeology of shipwrecks, Mack's book uses literary sources (Joseph Conrad, Herman Melville, and Richard Dana appear frequently) and focuses on the experience of being at sea.\nJohn Mack raises some interesting framing questions in the introduction to The Sea: why was Madagascar settled so much later than most other land masses of significance and why was a ship buried on a hill in Sutton Hoo in England? The first question relates to themes of how people get around at sea while the second relates to how people's experience of the sea eventually gets reflected in culture on land.\nHere is how John Mack outlines his book:\nEach of the chapters tackles a different aspect of the subject of man's engagement with the sea: the extent to which they interconnect culturally (or not); the ways in which the seas are conceptualized; ships and boats as social spaces; the ways in which the seas are navigated and related processes of enskillment; different practices in visualizing the sea; beaches as sites of interaction and the topics of language, gender and material culture in a maritime context. Finally we move back onto land and consider the significance of ships in a terrestrial context looking at the link between ships and churches, and ship-burials. Conceived as a series of themed chapters they none the less overlap and flow into one another – like the salt-water seas themselves.\nBasically, each chapter looks at a certain theme related to the experience of being at sea or the wider ways in which that experience has shaped culture. My favourite chapters were the first and third, which were about, respectively, the varying characteristics of different seas, and techniques for navigating before technology enabled knowing your position objectively. Chapter 2 deals with how the sea is conceptualized in different cultures, chapter 4 is about ship-board society, chapter 5 is about how beaches and ports are \"in-between\" spaces, and chapter 6 is on terrestrial reflections of aspects of maritime life.\nThe descriptions in the first chapter of characteristics of the most notable seas were enlightening. \"The compass and later iron shipping had the effect of rendering all seas the same\", but in previous times patterns of winds and currents had large effects on where people could sail. For example, since the Mediterranean only has a few main rivers and lots of evaporation, it has a higher salinity than the Atlantic Ocean. This results in a strong inward surface current at Gibraltar, making it difficult to sail outwards. The Red Sea has a similar feature. The Indian Ocean has the reversing Monsoon winds, which blow from the northeast from November – April and from the southwest from May – September. The Pacific Ocean has circulation cells that rotate in opposite directions north and south of the Equator (clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively), and produce boundary currents like the Humboldt along the western edge of the Americas.\nIn the third chapter, The Sea has an interesting perspective on traditional navigation, comparing it to a performance in the way that it is done in the moment and is a bit different every time:\nJust as two successive performances of a piece of music are different, so no two sea passages between islands are ever the same. Navigation is a complete, embodied, synaesthetic activity.\nThe book discusses ibn Majid, an Arab navigator who wrote guides to sailing the Indian Ocean in the fifteenth century. In spite of the factual nature of his subject matter, he did much of his writing in poetic verse. Mack draws parallels between the sensory engagement that is stimulated by poetry and the engagement with environment that good traditional navigation requires. Verse also serves a mnemonic function.\nPolynesian culture was also well-known for its navigational praxis. A Polynesian navigator named Tupaia, who sailed with Captain Cook, is discussed in The Sea. He made a map of Pacific Islands. The book discusses its differences with European maps, which attempted to locate positions on an objective grid of latitude and longitude whereas traditional Polynesian charts (Tupaia's chart was a hybrid) were more subjective mnemonics for the experience of travelling between pairs of islands.\nSomething I learned from this book that I found really interesting was about Celtic \"Peregrini\" monks. They would set out on the North Sea on small boats believing that their destination was in the hands of God:\nSome of this voyaging by the [mariner-monks] seems not to have been motivated by informed navigational assessment of the likelihood of finding land and more by a sense of submitting to the will of God.\nBut the fundamental concept which explained all this was at root theological. The sea, its monsters and its navigators were all God's creation. Thus, if the faithful were able to traverse this unstable world, to calm its water by prayer and establish settlements in such unlikely outposts as the rocks of Skellig Michael far out to sea, it was because it was God's will.\nThey established monasteries in remote places like Iona, Lindisfarne, Whithorn, and Skellig Michael.\nTo keep this review from getting too long, I won't say much about the contents of the other chapters. The key topics include social structures and taboos aboard ships, and how maritime symbolism can be seen in some aspects of culture on land (circling back to the ship burials mentioned in the introduction, as well as church architecture). I do, however, want to note some artists that were mentioned. Marine painting was developed in the Netherlands so a number of Dutch artists made the list:\nEach chapter begins with a literary quote to set the stage, and this one by Victor Hugo seems like a good one to wrap up this review with:\nThe sea's forces are mechanisms of infinite power; the ship's mechanisms are forces of limited power. Between these two organisms, one inexhaustible, the other intelligent, takes place the combat that is called navigation.\nTo wrap up this post, I'll link back to another book review I wrote that gets into imagery of water in the Bible. And finally, here is an apropos verse to tie things together:\nAll streams flow into the sea,\nyet the sea is never full.\nTo the place the streams come from,\nthere they return again. (Eccl. 1:7)\nPermalink",

    "content": "I was on vacation for a few days last week and went on a couple of fun day trips with my girlfriend.\nThe (free!) Irving Nature Park in Saint John offers some interesting short hikes through diverse ecosystems. I've mentioned it before, but haven't been hiking there in many years. So it was great to spend part of a day there last week.\nThe Irving Nature Park is remarkable for having such a variety of environments in a compact space—and so close to one of the largest cities in the province. The following image shows some of this variety, with views along a boardwalk through a tidal salt marsh, a woodland trail, and out over rocky coastal cliffs.\nThis look-out platform provided a view out over the salt marsh. This photo was taken close to low tide.\nAfter the hike, we went into Uptown Saint John. We got some tasty food at the City Market and visited a few shops of local artisans.\nThe day after going to Saint John, we went to St. Andrew's, which recently came #1 in a list of top 10 destinations in Canada by USA Today. While there, we went to a few shops in the charming downtown and also went on a whale watching cruise.\nSt. Andrew's is in the Passamaquody Bay, but the whale watching cruise took us out into the Bay of Fundy. We had to pass through a narrow channel between a couple of islands. Tidal currents were strong there.\nOn this particular day, we did not see any whales. It is still early in the season and not many have migrated into the bay yet. There has also been speculation after a number of dead whales were found in the Gulf of St. Lawrence that they may not be finding enough food in the Bay of Fundy so far this year and thus seeking other feeding grounds (where they could face higher risks of ship collisions). Even without seeing whales, the cruise was still worthwhile; we saw seals and porpoises while sailing around, and they took us to see an island that had a lot of seabirds nesting on it. They also took us to see a herring weir and a salmon aquaculture operation.\nMore information for things to do in this southwestern corner of New Brunswick around Charlotte County and the Passamaquoddy Bay can be found here.\nPermalink",

    "content": "On Saturday, I visited a new exhibit that had opened up at a local museum. I also had to travel to Truro, NS for my job and visited a museum there on Sunday. Note that I have a busy couple of weeks coming up, so I'm not planning to write a post next week. Check back in July for new content.\nThe Fredericton Region Museum recently opened a new exhibit called The Wabanaki Way about First Nations in New Brunswick. Wabanaki is a term that encompasses Mi'kmaq and Maliseet/Wolastoqiyik First Nations in New Brunswick plus some in the northeastern US such as the Penobscot.\nThis exhibit took up one room in the museum. It had cabinets with artifacts, a screen that cycled some old photos, and signs that told the story of First Nations history and culture in New Brunswick. The signs were in four languages: Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, English, and French. One weakness of this exhibit was that many the artifacts didn't have much in the way of labels to explain their significance and tie them into the story being told.\nHere are some of the items that were included in the display. On the left is a cabinet with some stone tools and on the right are some birch bark baskets. Apparently it was common for designs to be scratched into the dark layer of the birch bark.\n(Speaking of baskets, there is also a cool exhibition on right now at the Gallery on Queen that includes creative wooden baskets by Ralph Simpson, a retired forest ranger.)\nThe exhibit at the Fredericton Region Museum also had a pre-confederation letter from Lt. Gov. Thomas Carleton ordering that the lands of a reserve be respected. A copy of the Ganong map was included in the display as well, to show ancient canoe/portage routes in the province.\nIn Truro, I stopped at the Millbrook Cultural and Heritage Centre. I've mentioned this heritage centre before in my suggested travel itinerary for the Maritime Provinces, but can't recall the last time I've visited it. They have a small museum—and a really good gift shop.\nThe highlight of this museum, for me, was seeing a birch bark canoe that was in the process of being built. I wasn't there at the right time to actually see the builder working on it, which would have been even better. They also had a few completed canoes on display.\nThe Millbrook Cultural and Heritage Centre also had a petroglyph on display and various pieces of Mi'kmaq material culture such as the quillwork baskets in the following picture. At this museum, the artifacts had pretty thorough descriptions.\nOne interesting thing I learned at this museum was about the Treaty of Watertown, which was the first treaty signed by the US after the Declaration of Independence. To this day, Canadian Mi'kmaq are allowed to enlist in the US armed forces.\nI'll wrap this post up with a couple of park recommendations. While I was in Truro, I went for a short hike in Victoria Park; it has a really scenic ravine and waterfall. And on my drive home, I stopped briefly at the Sackville Waterfowl Park (which I've mentioned in a previous post).\nPermalink",

    "content": "From time to time, I like to read a journal article and share a review. Toward the end of this post you can also find some related and random links.\n\"The Water-Energy-Food Nexus and the Transboundary Context: Insights from Large Asian Rivers\", by Keskinen, Guillaume, Kattelus, Porkka, Räsänen, and Varis from Aalto University in Finland, was published in Water (an open-access journal) in 2016.\nHere is the Abstract:\nThe water-energy-food nexus is a topical subject for research and practice, reflecting the importance of these sectors for humankind and the complexity and magnitude of the challenges they are facing. While the nexus as a concept is not yet mature or fully tested in practice, it has already encouraged a range of approaches in a variety of contexts. This article provides a set of definitions recognizing three perspectives that see the nexus as an analytical tool, governance framework and as an emerging discourse. It discusses the implications that an international transboundary context brings to the nexus and vice versa. Based on a comparative analysis of three Asian regions—Central Asia, South Asia and the Mekong Region—and their related transboundary river basins, we propose that the transboundary context has three major implications: diversity of scales and perspectives, importance of state actors and importance of politics. Similarly, introducing the nexus as an approach in a transboundary context has a potential to provide new resources and approaches, alter existing actor dynamics and portray a richer picture of relationships. Overall, the significance of water-energy-food linkages and their direct impacts on water allocation mean that the nexus has the potential to complement existing approaches also in the transboundary river basins.\nThe water-energy nexus has been a topic on this blog before; including food is an increasing trend. Here is the definition the authors give:\nWater, energy and food are the key prerequisites for our existence, there is no life without them. They are also closely linked with water acting commonly as an enabler and in the areas of water scarcity, limiter for food and energy production. Globally, food production comprises the great majority of consumptive water use , while the most important renewable energy production types in particular, including hydropower, bioenergy and waste, are dependent on water. Hence, the idea of looking at these three aspects and their connections together is in no way new.\nThis journal article looks at the water-energy-food nexus from three perspectives, applies it to three transboundary (i.e. where a watershed is shared by multiple countries) regions, then considers a few implications. The perspectives that the authors consider are using the nexus concept defined above as an analytical tool (quantitative or qualitative), a governance framework, and a way of framing discussions about problems facing these resources. Applying a nexus-based analysis to three regions—Central Asia, South Asia, and South-East Asia—forms the core of this paper. Finally, the authors consider some implications of transboundary scenarios on nexus-based analysis and governance. Nexus analysis is complicated by the need to consider multiple scales (e.g. both watershed and political boundaries) and the role of politics and state actors. Conversely, the holistic nature of nexus-based analysis can open up new approaches in areas where there is competition over scarce water resources by bringing food and energy interests to the table as well.\nIn this post, I'm going to focus on one transboundary region discussed in the paper. The Mekong River watershed in Southeast Asia is shared by six countries including Vietnam, Cambodia, and China. Each region examined in this paper had a figure like the following to summarize the most significant impacts between water, energy, and food. The width of the lines denotes the importance of the impact indicated. In the case of South East Asia, the construction of hydroelectic dams can interfere with fish migration as well as flow patterns, which further impact fisheries. Apparently the Mekong River is \"one of the world's most productive inland fisheries\" so the impact of hydropower development on fisheries there makes it a very relevant example of the water-energy-food nexus.\n(this figure belongs to the authors/journal and is included for review and discussion purposes only)\nThe interaction between the elements of the nexus is different in each region. The summary figures like the one included above are effective at showing the regional similarities and differences.\nThe authors made a couple of really good points. One is that the concept of the water-energy-food nexus should also include major crops that are not used for food or energy, such as cotton in Uzbekistan. Another is that the boundaries for each element in the nexus are different: a watershed is a good scale to look at water issues, but an interconnected electrical transmission grid might be more appropriate for energy, while food is traded globally in modern times.\nThis journal article was quite clear to follow (especially with the effective figures that were included) and includes copious references.\nThere was a conference in Fredericton last week that relates to the inter-relationship between water, energy, and agri-/aqua-/silvi-culture: the Atlantic Biorefinery Conference. I didn't attend myself, but some of my colleagues were involved. Here is an article and a radio interview (both en français) that mention the company I work for.\nThe conference was held at the Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre, which has a driveway that connects to Knowledge Park, an IT office park. This physical proximity illustrates how the intersection of natural resources and high tech is now an important part of the NB economy. An infographic I shared in the past makes a similar point.\nOn an unrelated note, here are a few links that relate to some of my previous posts:\nThis article has a lot of overlap with a book I reviewed recently.\nI came across this art of Burpee Bar Island (which I kayaked to a couple of weeks ago).\nFinally, Orphan Black, a TV show I've written about before, began its final season this weekend.\nPermalink",

    "content": "There's a project I was working on and have written about before that I put on the back burner for a while but got back into this weekend. Here are the results.\nWhen I came up with the idea to try building a telescope, my goal was to use affordable components that could mostly be found in a typical hardware store. It is now assembled—and literally held together with duct tape and baling twine.\nHere are some photos I took while I was building the telescope:\nGoing in order from top-to-bottom, left-to-right, the composite image above shows details of some of the telescope components:\nAside from the 3D-printed angled bracket for the eyepiece mirror, everything can be found at typical hardware and craft stores. The bracket is something I designed on Sketch-Up; I've uploaded the design to Thingiverse.\nThe following picture shows the mount for my telescope. It stands around two feet high and was made from a single 6-ft 1\"x10\" pine board (plus a couple of smaller boards for bracing). It has two axes: the lazy susan bearing at the bottom and the dowel at the top. This gives it two degrees of freedom, which is sufficient to aim around the sky.\nHere is a picture of the assembled telescope:\nI cut the sonotube to be equal to the focal length calculated in my previous post about this project. The eyepiece is the same distance (25 cm) from the end as it is long, so the observer's eye is at a distance of f from the objective mirror.\nWhen I tested the telescope, the moon was blurry (there weren't any stars to aim it at due to some wispy clouds and haze last night), so I can't call this project a full success yet. It might be that the magnifying mirror simply isn't of sufficient quality for this application. Another possibility is that the focal length is wrong. I calculated the focal length by measuring the geometry of the mirror and calculating a radius (the calculated focal length is almost the same if it is parabolic instead of spherical) but if the glass was a variable thickness then I wouldn't have been measuring the actual curvature of the reflective surface. Or there could have been other sources of error.\nAnother way to determine the focal length of a magnifying mirror is the point at which the image flips upside down. This distance was different from the focal length that I had calculated. So I plan to modify the telescope to try this different assumed focal length and see if it provides a clearer image. I also want to improve the way that the telescope tube is attached to the mount (right now it is duct taped to a single board with a hole that the dowel goes through).\nPermalink",

I stopped at a few islands along the way. This post is mainly photos of the trip.\nMy first stop was on Burpee Bar Island, which is an NB Nature Trust Preserve. Their website has the following description:\nThe island is altered annually by ice scour and seasonally fluctuating water levels that are characteristic of the St. John River. Therefore, disturbance-driven species thrive in this habitat.\nIn my photo, I've added a horizontal line, showing how the dried grass stuck in tree branches gives a visual indication of how high the flood waters came.\nA short distance further was the downstream end of Sugar Island, which also has an NB Nature Trust reserve:\nThe floodplain islands (Sugar and the adjacent islands) have an unusual floodplain and prairie-type flora. The gravel strands, which are flooded annually, are effectively in a state of perpetual early succession.\nI ate a couple of samosas on a nice gravel beach and watched bald eagles and other birds (obviously cellphone photos don't do those magnificent birds justice).\nNext I went past Eqpahak Island, which I've written about before.\nOn Hartt Island and some of the others there were prominent scour marks in the banks:\nAfter I passed Hartt Island, I had to paddle into some waves since the wind had increased. To minimize the effort required, I stayed close to the shore of Nevers Island. I also landed briefly to see the interior of the island.\nThere were some fiddleheads (past the stage where I'd want to eat them) in the soil below the flood line:\nNext, I took the northern channel to be more sheltered from the wind and then the centre channel between Jewett and Clements islands.\nIn the final stretch of the journey, the river flows past downtown Fredericton:\nIncluding the stops on some of the islands, this trip took around 4.5 hours.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A week ago, I was privileged to attend a formal dinner; it seemed like a fitting topic to write a post about.\nWhen I graduated from UNB, in 2008, I won the Ketchum medal (awarded to the top graduating student in Civil Engineering). Every five years, there is a reunion dinner for previous winners—a great tradition to keep alive.\nThe dinner was held in a ballroom of the Old Government House and featured salmon. There were around two dozen people in attendance, spanning from graduation years of 1958 – 2017. Aside from the dinner and some socializing, there were some remarks about the medal's namesake, Henry Ketchum, as well as about an interesting project in the province that one of the attendees has been working on.\nHenry Ketchum was the first recipient of a civil engineering diploma from the University of New Brunswick. Lt. Gov. Sir Edmund Head advocated for an engineering faculty at UNB (Kings College at the time), resulting in a short course being offered in the spring of 1854—the first engineering course in Canada. This was attended by Ketchum and 25 other men. A few years later, a diploma program was started and Ketchum was the first graduate, in 1862.\nFrom the programme booklet prepared for the dinner, here is the syllabus for the civil engineering course in early 1854:\nAn explanation of the construction and uses of Logarithms, Sines, tangents, etc., Trigonometrical Formulæ; Resolution of Plane Triangles; methods of Surveying with Theodolite, Circumferenter, etc. Construction, use, and Adjustment of Instruments used by the Engineers, both for the field and office work; levelling: Method of determining best route for Railway, etc.; Computation of the quantities of land, earthwork, etc., required for the execution of the works; Horsepower and Machinery, etc.; Method of \"setting out\" Railway curves and side widths; Calculation of gradients and theory of inclined planes; Superelevation of rails; Composition and resolution of Forces; Calculation of strains and pressures; strength of materials; theory and practice of timber and iron framing; viaducts, bridges, etc.\nApparently Ketchum worked in Brazil for around five years, on the Santos to São Paulo railway; later he worked on a never-completed project to transport ships across the Chignecto Isthmus. The UNB Library has some additional information about Henry Ketchum.\nOne of the engineers at this dinner gave a brief presentation about his involvement with the Fundy Trail Parkway development which was quite interesting. He showed a video of the route taken by a drone. I found the video below on YouTube and it looks like the same one (or very, very similar):\nOne of the things I really appreciate about this dinner (this was my second time attending) is the sense of connection with the history of UNB and engineering in NB that it fosters. This comes from being with a lot of experienced engineers with stories to tell and hearing about some of the accomplishments of previous Ketchum medal winners who have already passed away (it was first awarded in 1897). Notable to me is the fact that many winners of the Ketchum medal have worked for ADI over the years. Finally, the Old Government House was built in the 1820s and has surely witnessed many formal dinners over the years, further boosting the sense of connection with provincial history.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a review of the book Quantified: Redefining Conservation for the Next Economy, by Joe Whitworth. At the start of this year, I included a TEDx talk he did in a post I wrote and mentioned that this book was on my reading list.\nI found Quantified to be a quick read. Most of the ideas in it weren't new to me (refer to the post that I linked in the introductory paragraph and other things I've written on this blog), but I thought the author did a great job presenting them; this would be a good starting point for someone interested in learning more about cutting-edge results-oriented approaches to conservation. Because of the author's role in The Freshwater Trust in Oregon, it is mainly focussed on conservation/restoration of rivers and fresh water, but certainly has wider applicability, too.\nQuantified is not a business book (per se), but it has a lot in common with that genre. The style reminded me of Real Life MBA by Jack and Suzie Welch which I read last year, for example, as they both have a lot of concrete examples and suggestions for practical applications. The similarities go further than that, with Joe Whitworth recommending improvement strategies for the conservation world that would not be out of place in the business world.\nSimply put, quantified conservation is a twenty-first-century approach to solving the twenty-first-century problems that confront us. It offers a framework built on the following five principles, all of which the business world relies on for its success: Situational awareness... Bold outcomes... Innovation and technology... Data and analytics... Gain\nThere are nine chapters in Quantified. The first one introduces Joe Whitworth's strategic approach, while the second and third attempt to define the problem facing conservation groups. Chapters 4 and 5 are on the use/needs of fresh water of agriculture and industry, respectively. Then the book turns to the topic of solutions/improvements. Chapter 6 is about how philanthropists and government granting agencies could allocate their funding more effectively. Chapter 7 is on the concept of water flow trading (as applied in the Murray-Darling basin in Australia) and chapter 8 is on water quality (e.g. nutrient credits) trading mechanisms. The final chapter is intended as an inspirational call to action.\nThe central focus is trying to get the best value out of the limited spending on conservation projects (specifically river restoration), and to leverage further investment by demonstrating results:\nAnd the immutable truth is that restoration takes cash. We've got to pay for these projects with both public and private dollars. Quantified conservation allows us to stretch existing dollars by tying them to measurable gains achieved for the environment. It also paves the way for market mechanics to channel additional funding into restoration while using proper design to balance the needs of the environment with those of the economy.\n...\nIt's hard to imagine any successful twenty-first-century business spending money on a program without measuring its results. Yet when it comes to environmental funding, that's exactly what we're doing. Each year, we spend billions of public and private dollars on freshwater ecosystems in the United States without truly knowing what we're getting. (emphasis added)\nI liked how the book took a balanced view, rather than an us-vs-them posture toward businesses and farmers:\nThe reality is that we need agriculture and industry, and we need a healthy environment. In this era, these are not \"nice-to-haves\". These are \"gotta haves\". There's no getting around the fact that humans will use resources—we always have throughout our existence. We need to eat, so we need farms. We also need to eat in the long term, so we need agriculture to operate within a healthy ecosystem. Likewise, we need clothing, housing, transportation, and a range of other daily necessities, so we need industry.\nI think this is wise, because the business world can adapt quickly once it is convinced a new way of doing things is worthwhile. As the author notes, about 2/3 of Global 500 companies have already put in water efficiency measures. And just recently I saw news that Walmart is pressuring its suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Businesses see this as a way to reduce their exposure to risks facing natural resources. This perspective is becoming quite mainstream, with Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, writing a book (which I haven't read yet) that apparently discusses how businesses can have a positive environmental impact.\nChapter five is quite relevant to what I do professionally, as it discusses the freshwater needs of industry. In fact, I decided to share the following quote from that chapter on LinkedIn:\nWithout [freshwater], the corporate world would grind to a halt. From automobile manufacturing to consumer packaged goods to high-tech, almost every industry relies on water for at least some part of its process. Water is behind almost every product we buy, yet most people are unaware of it.\n...\nMaking smart decisions about water is critical to corporate risk management. A solid water use plan reduces a company's operational costs. It prevents disruptions to production. It helps companies avoid conflict with farmers and communities. And it ensures that the company has enough water to secure its operations well into the future.\nThat chapter has many examples of water footprints of various goods, and of how various companies have faced water issues. I was familiar with some of them from conferences I've attended and other books I've read, but also encountered some examples that were new to me.\nWater quality credit trading (typically on temperature, nutrients, or sediment) is something I've come across before, so I found the discussion about it in Chapter 8 to be interesting. The author has some suggestions on how water quality credit markets should be designed to be most effective. The goal is to promote spending on natural infrastructure (e.g. riverbank restoration), not just built environmental infrastructure (e.g. cooling towers) in cases where the former would provide better value for a given investment.\nNutrient overload is an issue in the Mississippi River due to the amount of intensive agriculture that occurs in its watershed. This causes a \"dead zone\" in the Gulf of Mexico near its mouth. One thing I found notable was the possible impact on water quality from efforts to reduce the use of fossil fuels by growing more corn for making biofuel (ethanol):\nBoth the amount of nutrients and the size of the dead zone at [the Mississippi's] mouth are expected to expand as a result of the federal mandate to grow corn for ethanol.\nThis illustrates the unintended consequences that can arise from such top-down mandates. A nutrient credit market would be a more decentralized approach that, if properly designed, should channel financing toward the local solutions with the best return on investment.\nToward the end of Quantified, there were frequent mentions of \"ecosystem services\". That is, the author feels that we should put a value not only on natural resources, but also on natural services:\n[science and technology] can bridge the gap between economic and environmental interests by giving them a common language with which to make tradeoffs. ... We now have the tools to accurately describe the environment according to the services it provides to humans and to broader ecosystem resilience, and we can quantify these services in a way that can ultimately assign them a dollar value in order to make the right tradeoff.\nFor evidence that a new way of looking at the world has been taking hold, check out almost any website that discusses ecological issues, and you'll read about nature performing vital services that can be assigned a quantified value and translated into dollars. The idea of ecosystem services has been rapidly spreading, and it's gradually replacing the old idea that the economy and the environment are at opposite corners of the boxing ring. The idea that what's good for the environment is bad for the economy has passed its \"use-by\" date, and it's giving way to a new paradigm in which the economy and the environment are an integrated whole.\nThese services can range from provisioning food, to controlling erosion, to pollinating crops, to cultural/recreational value.\nI think things like markets for water rights and nutrient credits can be implemented in the short-term (and indeed are in some places), while this vision of valuing ecosystem services in a quantified, comprehensive way is probably further over the horizon.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about flooding, along with some thoughts on public art installations. I made a timelapse .gif of a sculpture along the Saint John River in Fredericton that was designed to show the water level.\nWatermark by Gerald Beaulieu is a public art installation in downtown Fredericton. It consists of 11 pillars of varying heights. Ten of them range from elevations (not total height, since the spot where they are installed has an elevation of about 6 metres above sea level) of 6.5 to 8.75 m, in increments of 0.25 m. The eleventh, tallest, pillar has years marked on it representing the levels reached by historical floods. So the number of pillars that are submerged gives an indication of the water level and the tallest pillar allows comparisons to the past. A level of 6.5 m (i.e. up to the top of the shortest post) means the river has officially reached flood stage; 8.36 m is the highest level reached in recent years (2008).\nHere is a photo of this sculpture with the river just starting to overflow its banks:\nI had the idea to take photos from the same location on a regular basis (I was travelling a bit, but got some pictures a couple of times a week on average) during the spring flooding season then combine them to illustrate how the sculpture interacts with the rising waters. The result was this .gif:\nThe images that I used to make the .gif were taken between 31 March and 8 May, 2017. The time between images was based on how many days elapsed between when they were taken (0.3 sec allotted per day). I used GIMP to make the .gif; lowering the layer opacity temporarily was helpful to line up the sculpture between frames.\nAside from the changes in water levels, you can see decreasing snow and increasing green, flotsam left at the high water line, and various weather conditions (including a late-April snowfall). This year was thankfully not a serious flooding year in Fredericton—spare a thought and a prayer for people around Ottawa and Montreal who are facing much worse conditions—so only the first pillar and almost the second were submerged. Interestingly, the flood stage of 6.5 m was reached twice this year, falling from the initial peak then rising to a slightly higher one (I think) more recently. If the peaks had occurred at the same time, it could have been more serious. At the time of publication, the water level appears to have stabilized from the second peak, but it could be a while before it subsides due to the amount of rainfall in the forecast.\nI like this sculpture. In my opinion, public art installations should be conversant with their surroundings. That is, if they would make as much (or as little) sense no matter where they are installed then I don't see the point of having them as a public installation. There are many ways art can interact with and enrich its surroundings, from memorializing local people or history, to using materials and forms that reflect the local environment, to a dynamic interaction like Watermark. It is uniquely designed for where it is located.\nWhen I was in Edinburgh, I learned that a lot of the sculptures/monuments there had been funded by public subscription. I think funding models that directly engage the public (instead of only funding committees) have a higher chance of producing art that people like and find interesting. (Watermark was commissioned by the City, I believe, and seems to be well-received, but it isn't hard to find publicly-funded art installations that have no discernible significance and little appeal). I feel that the rise of crowd-funding sites could be a really positive thing for art as they both raise money and engage audiences. Kickstarter, for example, raised over $400M in 2016 for projects in art/cultural categories (compared to a budget of around $150M for the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts). An art project I made a small contribution to is 23 Days at Sea. It was a residency, but I've also seen some public installation art projects on Kickstarter.\nHere are some additional links about flooding on the Saint John River:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This weekend, I got my kayak out from winter storage and paddled around the mouth of the Nashwaak River.\nAround a month and a half ago, I was snowshoeing, but now the weather has warmed up enough to get out on the water.\nBecause of the high water level, I had to duck to get under the trail bridge near the mouth of the Nashwaak River on this trip.\nIn the spring, I love taking advantage of high water levels to appreciate places that aren't normally accessible (last spring I spent an afternoon in Portobello Creek, for example). Along the Saint John River and its tributaries, the flood plains are forested in many places; for a few weeks each year it is possible to go paddling among the trees.\nIt's very secluded and peaceful.\nAnnual flood disturbances mean that the flood-tolerant silver maples in these zones don't have to compete with flood-intolerant species (like oaks, as in the song by Rush) for light and nutrients.\nThe Nashwaak Watershed Association is working to preserve and restore these floodplain forests. Among other things, they are reportedly valuable for mitigating flooding elsewhere:\nSilver maple floodplain forests are estimated to be worth approximately $72,000 USD/hectare/year based on flood mitigation alone.\nI picked up a book called More of Canada's Best Canoe Routes in a used bookstore a while ago. Its chapter on the Saint John River is subtitled \"The Flooded Forest\". Here is an excerpt:\nIn spring, when a raw Atlantic is scarcely warmer than the Arctic, this is a welcome waterway. Of particular interest is the stretch between Burton and Hampstead, where the freshet (spring melt) invades the floodplains, opening up a tangle of tree trunks and canals — an environment that is unique in Canada and reminiscent of the mangrove swamps of the southern United States.\nThe rising river carves the banks and inundates the islands, depositing mud and silt to nourish the red maple. Fiddleheads, the delectable young sprouts of the ostrich fern, poke up through the water, the first sight of green in an otherwise dull decor of muted colors. Barren branches sound a cacophony of warblers, pausing on their way further north, and the tapping of woodpeckers into widespread deadwood. Osprey have also moved onto the bleached trunks of the dead American elms that once lined the valley.\nOn the subject of good canoe and kayak routes in Canada, I recently came across some suggestions from Olympian Adam van Koeverden as well as from another interesting site.\nFor my next post, I plan to have some more photos related to the spring freshet, so stay tuned!\nPermalink",

    "content": "A coworker recently recommended the game Kerbal Space Program (KSP) to me. I've been enjoying it.\nI don’t spend a lot of time gaming, but from time to time I like to get into one. I especially like open-ended games (where you choose what to do instead of following a linear storyline—Crusader Kings II is another one like this) that verge on being simulators. Often these kinds of games have steep learning curves; KSP is no exception. The game involves designing rockets then launching and piloting them. With a little bit of trial and error, I was able to get into space. But just up and back, like some space tourism companies have proposed. Getting into a stable orbit was a completely different matter. After playing the in-game tutorial, reading some tips, and more practice piloting, I finally achieved it. Getting into orbit is really only the first step, as the game includes moons and planets to explore, and new spacecraft components that are unlocked as you play.\nThe first image below shows a rocket in KSP shortly after launch. The next image shows the map mode, where you can plan navigational maneuvers to adjust your orbit.\nThe graphics are cartoonish, but the physics in KSP is quite realistic*. The website even includes some reference equations, although you don't need them to play the game.\nA spacecraft (or anything else) in orbit has a constantly-changing position and velocity. These are both in 3 dimensions, for a total of 6 dimensions. Alternatively, 6 orbital elements can be used to define the shape of the orbit and the progress around it. Changing an orbit involves firing a rocket to adjust speed (Δv) at a certain point. This point will still be on the orbit while the shape of the orbit is most affected at far away points; for example, maneuvers at apsis have the biggest impact on periapsis. I'm looking forward to trying some various maneuvers in KSP, once I can get a ship into orbit with fuel to spare.\nI've written before about watching 'The Expanse'. Season 2 just finished, and it is still going strong. One of the neat things about that show is its realism. When there are navigational screens shown (e.g. the still shown below from this clip) they display curved orbits, for example. And ships flip around and burn their engines while travelling in reverse to decelerate.\nFinally, here are a couple of thoughts to end this post:\n* There are some simplifications in the simulation. To bring this post full circle, the three-body problem wouldn't occur in KSP, since each area of space is assumed to only be under the influence of one celestial body at a time.\nPermalink",

This difference in apparent spacing produces the Moiré pattern.\nLooking at it mathematically, if the grid spacing is ℓ then the apparent grid spacing for the back panel will be:\nℓ' = ℓ ˙ d1 / d2,\nwhere d represents the distance of each panel to the observer.\nThe wavelength of the Moiré pattern (using the equation given in the Wikipedia article with a small change in notation) will be:\nλ = ℓ2 / δℓ,\nwhere δℓ = abs(ℓ - ℓ')\nPatterns in which the spacing is very similar will have a long wavelength for their Moiré patterns (i.e. a low beat frequency).\nThis makes me wonder if Moiré patterns could be used for some range-finding applications?\nThis webpage has a cool interactive app for generating Moiré patterns.\nWhile I'm talking about math, here's a random article that I came across recently. It touches on tiling, among other things.\nOn a completely different topic, this past weekend I attended the annual Reel Paddling Film Festival screening in Fredericton for my second time. I'm not going to write a full post about it, but did want to share a clip from Botella, a film I liked:\nOther films at this festival that I liked included Noatak and Rediscover North America.\nPermalink",

The 6th edition of the book only goes up to 2014. New additions are listed here by year.\nTo start off, here is a list of UNESCO sites that I've seen. It includes links to the official page for each site, which contains a description and photo gallery. If I've written a blog post myself that includes pictures or a description, I've also linked to it.\nThis list represents a bit over 1% of the total number of UNESCO sites. There are a similar number of other sites that I have been close to but haven't visited:\nThere are a number of other UNESCO sites I would like to visit. Here are the top 12 (ordered by their official number, not by my level of interest):\nOther interesting directories maintained by UNESCO include biosphere reserves and intangible cultural heritage.\nTo wrap this post up, I'll circle back to Lunenburg and share a couple of photos from the town:\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is intended to complement the previous one with a more theoretical look at dissolving carbon dioxide in water.\nI wrote a script in R to draw a Deffeyes diagram. This diagram shows the interplay between CO2, pH, and alkalinity. My main reference was the venerable Water Chemistry textbook by Snoeyink and Jenkins (1980).\nHere is the script:\nHere is the diagram:\nThe total carbonate concentration is shown on the x-axis, the total alkalinity (in meq/L; 1 meq = 50 mg/L as CaCO3) is shown on the y-axis, and the lines indicate pH values. Note that the quantity on the x-axis includes not only dissolved CO2 (i.e. CO2(aq)), but also bicarbonate and carbonate ions. The Henry's Law calculations in my post last week only give the dissolved CO2 concentration, but at neutral or higher pH values the amount that dissociates into ions will be significant—so my CO2 cylinder probably won't last as long as predicted.\nAdding a strong acid or strong base means moving down or up (respectively) the y-axis, while adding CO2 (e.g. by increasing the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase over the water) at a constant alkalinity means moving along the x-axis; additions of chemicals that contribute both carbonate and alkalinity (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate) require diagonal movements. Diluting the solution requires a 1:1 movement toward the origin. Since the pH lines have different slopes, dilutions can change the pH of the solution. Determining the post-dilution pH can be a lot easier graphically using the Deffeyes diagram than by doing calculations.\nI also made another version of the diagram at higher ranges of carbonate and alkalinity concentrations to try to be relevant to anaerobic wastewater treatment:\nIt should actually have a higher range than it does: 12 mmol/L of carbonate is only the amount of dissolved CO2 (so not counting bicarbonate and carbonate ions, which will be significant at the pH values shown) given by Henry's Law, at a CO2 partial pressure of 0.35 atm which is typical for the headspace of an anaerobic digester.\nIt would be interesting to add calculations to the script above to calculate the corresponding gas phase CO2 partial pressure from the total carbonate and the pH (using Henry's Law and dissociation constants) and use that on the x-axis instead.\nAside from the carbonate system, phosphate, sulfate, and volatile organic acids are also involved in alkalinity/buffering pH. I don't know how valid this diagram is in situations where their concentrations are significant.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about a DIY project I just did to get carbonated water at home, without getting a Sodastream.\nI mostly followed the project description from this article, with a few small changes. Mainly, I got my CO2 cylinder from a home brewing supply store rather than using one intended for paintball, to ensure that the gas would be food-grade. Some similar projects that I found on other websites involved upgrading a Sodastream and this detailed description of a heavy-duty home carbonation rig.\nThe parts that I used were:\nAssembling it was a simple matter of screwing the regulator onto the cylinder and connecting the tubing to the barbed fittings on the regulator and the ball lock assembly using hose clamps. The ball lock assembly connects to the carbonator cap; they both close when disconnected, preventing gas from escaping.\nHere is a photo of the assembled apparatus:\nWith the pop bottle 3/4 filled with chilled water, it can be carbonated by opening the valves, using the regulator to set the desired pressure. Shaking creates lots of bubbles and helps the CO2 dissolve faster. At first, I tried a pressure of 30 psi, but I think increasing it to 35 or 40 psi will give better results. Running the water through a carbon filter first would also be nice, as that would eliminate the chlorine taste that tap water has.\nI want to be sure that I'm using pressures that are well below what the components can safely handle. The polyethylene tubing is rated for 120 psi, and plastic pop bottles can apparently handle 100 psi.\nHenry's Law concerns how much gas can dissolve in water. The concentration that can be dissolved is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas (absolute pressure times the fraction of the gas out of all gases present). Compared to many other gases, more CO2 can dissolve at the same partial pressure (because it forms an acid and then ionizes); its Henry's Law constant is higher than those of oxygen or nitrogen or methane. For another post I calculated oxygen solubility. Now I'm going to present a calculation of CO2 solubility.\nThe molar mass of CO2 is 44 g/mol. Its Henry's Law constant at 25°C is Kh = 0.034 mol/L-atm. Assuming a pressure of 40 psi (2.85 atm gauge pressure = 3.85 atm absolute pressure) in the headspace of the bottle, the concentration of CO2 that will be dissolved can be calculated as:\nCaq = Kh * P = (0.034 mol/L-atm * 44 g/mol) * 3.85 atm = 5.7 g/L\nThe cylinder contains 5 lbs (2270 g) of CO2, so 2270 g / (5.7 g/L) = 400 L can be carbonated. Refilling the cylinder costs $25, so each litre of water takes 6.25 cents to carbonate.\nPermalink",

    "content": "My previous post was about my experiences in Brazil; this post is about some things I learned about the history and culture of that country.\nBefore I went to Brazil, I took a short, free, online course about its history. The course was called Brazil for Beginners and was offered through Udemy. It had around five hours of lectures (around 20 min. each) and comprised an introductory profile of the country followed by an outline of its history.\nBrazil is a huge country, both in area and in population (5th in the world at 200+ million people). It is an industrial and agricultural powerhouse and is self-sufficient in energy. Unlike many large countries, it doesn't have any separatist movements. There are five major regions in Brazil:\nAside from this basic overview, I also learned about the history of Brazil through this course. Here are some of the significant events and people:\nThe situation with the Brazilian monarchy, where a European royal house relocated to the Americas, was more-or-less unique in the New World.\nDuring Brazilian history, plantation owners—first for sugarcane then later coffee planters—have been a potent political force. I'll have more to say on that below.\n\"Brazil for Beginners\" was the first online course of its kind that I've taken, but I doubt it will be the last. It's great to have access to such a wide variety of options these days for learning for personal interest or even continuing education purposes. In light of concerns about student debt and the rising cost of post-secondary education, I can even see these kinds of courses being a way for self-motivated students to affordably get their \"101\" credits (for lecture courses, not ones that rely on labs or 1-on-1 interaction) if they get accredited for transfer to traditional universities.\nIn addition to the course that I took, I've also learned a bit about Brazilian history through a book I'm reading called Uncommon Grounds. It is about the history of coffee, but, as I mentioned, coffee has been very important in Brazilian history.\nCoffee cultivation used to be jealously protected. Just as the Dutch smuggled a coffee tree from Aden, Yemen to Holland in 1616, some coffee seeds were smuggled into Brazil from French Guiana in 1727. Later, the royal family promoted coffee production in Brazil by sponsoring botanical research and distributing seedlings. Slave labour was the mainstay of coffee plantations until abolition; afterwards the planters enticed immigrants from Europe (Italy, etc.) to work on their plantations.\nThe author, Mark Pendergrast, includes this quote from an 18th century traveller to the Caribbean to illustrate the way slavery was intertwined with coffee and sugar production:\n\"I do not know if coffee and sugar are essential to the happiness of Europe, but I know well that these two products have accounted for the unhappiness of two great regions of the world: America ... [&] Africa\" (p.17)\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, Brazil was unrivalled for global coffee production. Apparently by 1900, there were half a billion coffee trees in the state of São Paulo. The port of Santos alone (not counting other ports in Brazil) shipped half of global coffee production in 1901 following a bumper crop. (Even though the city of São Paulo is less than 100 km from the coast, it is separated from the sea by a dramatic mountain range. The nearby coastal city of Santos is thus the main port for SP state. If I go back to Brazil, I think it sounds like an interesting place to try to visit.).\nCoffee production in Brazil was aimed more at quantity than quality, according to Uncommon Grounds. For example, they grew coffee directly in the sun rather than in the shade, which leads to faster growth but is less sustainable. They also used a system of supply management to try to keep the price that growers would receive from dropping too low if production outpaced demand. This involved warehousing excess production if the price of coffee in global markets dropped below targets. In spite of these efforts, coffee prices still underwent boom and bust cycles. In fact, the price of coffee as a commodity crashed two weeks before the start of the Great Depression—an early warning of sorts. It is difficult for a single country to control the price of a global commodity (Central American countries and Colombia were increasing their exports); in the 1930s, Brazil resorted to burning millions of bags of beans per year rather than selling them and seeing the price drop from such a surplus of supply. In the late 1930s Vargas ended this practice and allowed more of a free market in coffee exports. Brazil was becoming industrialized by the inter-war period, so the economy was less dependent on a single export and coffee barons had relatively less political power.\nUncommon Grounds also talks about coffee production in other countries and its distribution/advertising/consumption in the US and Europe. This includes the origin of coffee brands such as Folgers and Maxwell House that are still around today along with many that went out of business over the years. I'm finding the parts about the coffee growing countries to be the more interesting parts of the book, though.\nSomething random I learned about Brazil from these sources and also from being there is that Italy was a big source of immigrants and there is a large Italian community there. Brazil was also the only Latin American country to fight in World War 2, sending soldiers to the campaign against the fascists in Italy.\nI'll finish this post off with a few more photos that I took on my visit:\nLarge-scale agriculture, for crops such as sugarcane and coffee, is a key sector in the Brazilian economy (although they have diversified with a lot of manufacturing and other industry compared to a century ago). Here is a farm growing sugarcane:\nOne of the uses for sugarcane is in the production of cachaça; 51 is a major brand:\nThe Pirassununga campus of the University of São Paulo is located on an enormous former farm and runs zoology and food engineering programs. This illustrates the ongoing importance of agriculture in Brazil:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I just got back from a 12-day business trip to Brazil. In this post, I'll share a bit about my experiences and impressions there.\nAs I was there on a business trip, my experience was quite different than if I had gone as a tourist. The weekdays were mainly filled with meetings; the photos below are all from a weekend trip to the city of São Paulo (the city where I was staying was 200 km away, but still in São Paulo (SP) state). An interesting aspect to travelling for business is that I find it gives you more exposure to the \"normal\" places in a country or region, and a glimpse of everyday life. My colleagues in Brazil were wonderfully generous in their hospitality. One of them showed me around São Paulo on the weekend as I'll discuss below, and I also got invited into a few Brazilian homes and family gatherings.\nI didn't have to eat alone hardly at all, which was a relief because I don't know enough Portuguese to order anything interesting. As it was, I got to try lots of new and tasty things. These included Brazilian dishes such as carne-de-sol, pastéis (they have one with guava and fresh cheese called a \"Romeo and Juliet\"), farofa and cassava, and açaí (and other fruits). Portuguese and Italian cuisine was also readily available there, so I enjoyed some baked cod and some great pizza.\nAs I mentioned, one of my colleagues showed me around the city of São Paulo one weekend. It is among the biggest cities in the world and the weekend I was there was the weekend before Carnaval, so it was very bustling. The city is actually known for closing down streets for pre-Carnaval block parties (\"blocos\"); on Saturday night, it took two hours to drive between two places 5 km apart.\nAs this picture (from the roof-top patio of a hotel) shows, the city has high-rise buildings stretching farther than the eye can see.\nOn Saturday night, after seeing a couple of \"blocos\" and a flea market, we went to Parque Ibirapuera. This bridge over the lake was apparently built in homage to a Monet painting.\nOn Sunday, we went to the historic Luz train station. Next to the station is a museum of Brazilian art called the Pinacoteca. This museum had a great collection of works by Brazilian artists such as Almeida Junior, Dario Villares Barbosa, and many others. The rooms were well-arranged putting different periods in chronological order. There is also a nice park next to the train station and the gallery.\nWe also went to the Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP). This gallery has more of an internationally-focused collection that includes artists such as Cezanne and Van Gogh. It has an interesting layout, with the main exhibition space not divided into rooms, but kept open with paintings displayed on free-standing glass panels. Another part of the gallery had a temporary exhibit on Brazilian artist Agostinho Batista de Freitas who painted lots of scenes of São Paulo.\nMASP is on Avenida Paulista, which is like the Wall Street of Brazil. It is partially closed to traffic on Sundays and filled with people listening to street musicians, enjoying the sun, etc.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about a book I finished reading recently. Compared to many of the book reviews I've written, this one took longer to read but the review is maybe a bit shorter.\nThe Sea & Civilization: A Maritime History of the World by Lincoln Paine is an ambitious overview of the history of human activity at sea. The introduction explains the paradigm of the book:\n[A] shift in emphasis from land to water makes many trends and patterns of world history stand out in ways they simply cannot otherwise. ...\nmaritime historians looking past nationalist paradigms have embraced the validity of treating seas and ocean basins as coherent units of study. ...\nThis book is less about ships per se than about the things they carried—people and their culture, their material creations, their crops and flocks, their conflicts and prejudices, their expectations for the future, and their memories of the past.\nEach chapter looks at a part of the ocean during a historical era. The Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, North Sea and Baltic, and East Asia (South China Sea, etc.) are featured multiple times each, while later chapters consider the Atlantic and Pacific or the globe as a whole as distances sailed increased.\nThe author seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of ships and marine history. For example, he frequently lists dimensions (e.g. length, beam, and draft in metres) or tonnage when discussing historic ships. The level of detail made it a long read, although certainly interesting. I think it would actually work well to read it as a reference book—to consult a single chapter (i.e. for an ocean and historical era) at a time, or to search through the book for sections on a particular country or other topic/theme of interest (i.e. follow a single thread rather than read the whole thing).\nThe book is really too comprehensive to easily summarize, so instead I've decided to pick around a dozen interesting things that I learned to share.\nOne of the earliest chapters discussed Polynesian navigation and exploration techniques. They knew how to detect islands from beyond visual range by patterns in the swell, birds and wildlife, reflection of light, etc. They also made sure they would be able to find their way home by exploring downwind when the winds changed with the reliance that they would eventually return to the prevailing direction to assist with the homeward journey. 'Their approach to celestial navigation requires memorizing \"the direction of every known island from every other one\"' in terms of stars that rise/set along that bearing; they used reference \"etak\" islands to know how those bearings would change as the journey progressed (if I understand correctly). (Links: 1, 2, 3, 4).\nMany people are familiar with war elephants used by Hannibal, but in Sea & Civilization, I read about the Ptolemies importing elephants to Egypt over 300 nautical miles by ship from the 260s BCE. Apparently shipwrecks were not unknown on this trade.\nReading about the Indian Ocean (the Monsoon sea) was quite interesting, as I was far less aware of its history than that of the Mediterranean. Due to the Monsoon (with Winter prevailing winds from northeast and summer from south or southwest), \"Sailors did not hesitate to sail across two thousand miles of open ocean between Aden and southern India or Sri Lanka, but they did so only when the winds were in their favor.\" Southern India was a perennial meeting point between the east and west, and the Tamils that live there have a long history of trade. After reading this book I also have a better understanding of Indian geography, such as the Konkan, Malabar, and Coromandel coasts (in counterclockwise order).\nBetween the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean is the Red Sea, which is risky to transit due to its treacherous shallow reefs and lack of spots to replenish food or fresh water along its shores. Still, there was trade between these seas more than I think most people realize. The port of Alexandria in Egypt was important as a transshipment hub.\nMediterranean traders became directly involved in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean in the fourth century BCE and their contacts intensified following Rome's annexation of Egypt three hundred years later.\nSea & Civilization has much to say about the evolution of international maritime law and finance. Notable sources include the Byzantine Rhodian Sea Laws, the Islamic qirad and Italian commenda, and Dutch scholar Hugo Grotius.\nIn some of the chapters about the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean, I read things that I had included on my timelines of cities in the Middle East. I also learned about some things that I didn't include, such as the Zanj slave rebellion in Baghdad in the 870s and setbacks for the Byzantines in the 600s (invasions of the Visigoths in Spain and the Sassanians in the Levant).\nA work on marine history obviously has to include the Vikings, and this one has a lot of interesting information about them. The author points out that Scandinavians are \"not an undifferentiated mass\" and that in their seafaring generally Danes went west and south (England and France), the Norse went west (Iceland, Greenland, Ireland, Scotland), and the Swedes went east (Russia). Dublin was a key Viking (Norse) city, as were Novgorod and Kiev, which lay on a important North-South trade route to the Byzantines.\nAround the same time period (i.e. the ninth century ±) as the peak of Viking activity, seafaring was also prominent in Indonesia. Srivijaya and East Java received traffic from the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia and China; the pattern of the monsoon winds and the Strait of Malacca made them logical hubs for trade in spices* and other commodities.\nSrivijaya's prosperity depended on its ability to generate the surplus food, mostly rice, to sustain large communities, especially during the interlude between the monsoons.\nbut the nature of the monsoon meant that buyers and sellers of spices rarely encountered one another. The winter monsoon that brought western traders to East Java to purchase spices and exotic woods sent the purveyors of those goods homeward to the east.\n*cloves and nutmeg come from very specific islands (Ternate & Tidore and Banda islands, respectively) in eastern Indonesia—they were not transplanted elsewhere until the sixteenth century\nChinese naval history gets a few chapters of coverage. Quanzhou was a very significant port at one time; the Hokkien people of Fujian province were well-represented among merchant communities in South East Asia. Zheng He was a famous Chinese explorer. At other times in Chinese history, however, overseas trade was tightly restricted.\nThe Spanish Manila galleon was a long range trade route between the Philippines and Mexico. Due to the pattern of winds in the Pacific, the crossing from West to East ran at 39°N.\nOutside of western Europe, some interesting figures in naval history included Admiral Yi of Korea and Tsar Peter the Great. The latter was so dedicated to developing Russia's navy that he worked incognito at a shipyard in the Netherlands to learn the state-of-the-art techniques.\nSea & Civilization mentions many historically notable maps and charts, such as Piri Reis' and the Atlantic Neptune.\nThe pace of development in naval technology over the past 300 years has been remarkable. In the 18th and 19th century, elegant sailboats like schooners were developed as people applied \"theoretically sound refinements to hull design and route selection\" (compared to the 16th century when warships still used oars). This was followed by successful transatlantic steamships by the end of the 1830s—the first two crossings arrived in New York City a day apart in 1838. Steamships reigned for a century (they were still 80 percent of world fleet in 1935) but sailing ships remained competitive for many applications as owners could save money on fuel and crews. Many advances in routes, navigation, and safety during this period benefitted ships of all kinds. In the past 60 years containerization (among other factors) has made shipping so efficient that it is more significant but less visible than in most previous eras. The author calls maritime trade the \"midwife and mirror\" of globalization.\nThis book has lots of pictures of primary sources (paintings and carvings of historical ships) and a section of maps at the start. I think it could use more diagrams (e.g. of types of rigging, or ship construction—or at least a glossary of these things) and more detailed/higher resolution maps.\nPermalink",

    "content": "As I did the past two years, I went through the New Brunswick provincial budget document that was released today and have some context and analysis to share. In order to keep this tradition useful, I decided to focus a bit closer on one department (Environment and Local Government) this time.\nLast year I read a book called Real Life MBA by Jack and Suzy Welch. They wrote,\nOh, how we love variance analysis—comparing key numbers month over month, or year over year, or comparing them to plan, to see what's working in your organization and what isn't.\nTo build on my post from last year, I'll primarily discuss variance in spending and revenue on a year over year basis.\nThis first graph shows how spending in various departments has increased or decreased. It is calculated as a percentage, so a small increase (2.4%) in Health spending has a bigger impact than a large increase (10%, but only due to how I rounded) in Finance spending since the latter department has a budget of $10.5M compared to $2657M for the former. Tourism is up 15% (an $8M increase), which I think can be mainly attributed to Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations. The Regional Development Corporation has had a significant cut of $38M. The numbers used to make this graph come from p. 16 in the budget document (linked below).\nThe second graph shows how revenue from various sources has increased or decreased. It is also calculated as a percentage. The revenue from most taxes is expected to increase in the 2017 (and early 2018) fiscal year. The exception is a small projected decrease in gas tax revenue. The big mover is the HST, which is expected to bring in $1419M (up 14%) in the fiscal year ahead; it is the second largest tax (by revenue, not necessarily by rate) after personal income tax. Royalties (largely from timber) are expected to dip by $10M. There is no carbon tax included in this budget. The numbers used to make this graph come from pages 167 – 169 in the budget document.\nHere are where some of the key numbers stand now (i.e. budgeted for the fiscal year ahead):\nThe budget is summarized on p. 6 and the debt update is on p. 10. Some things to note are that the debt total at the start of the past fiscal year was revised upwards (after some consolidated financial statements were released—I don't understand all the details here) by $670M, and that the projected deficit for this year is fairly close to the $181M that was in the outlook/forecast in the current government's election platform (see table in this post). Also note that the contingency fund that was in the past two budgets has been dropped. A significant point in my view is that the total expenditures two years ago were $8630M, which is less than current revenue. If the government had been able to hold spending increases lower, then the budget could have been balanced by now without true cuts.\nThe largest departments by spending are:\nOn the revenue side, taxes account for $4519M while transfers from the Federal government account for $3061M ($1760M of this is Equalization payments). The remainder of revenue is from things like investments, licenses, fees, leases, royalties, the lottery, etc.\nThe Department of Environment and Local Government has a budget of $140M in 2017.\nThe purpose of Local Government programs is,\nTo serve as the primary point of contact between the Provincial Government and communities (incorporated and unincorporated). To provide\nprofessional financial advice, oversight and reporting services to municipalities, local service districts and rural communities; to build governance capacity at the local level by providing advisory services to municipalities and rural communities; and to provide for the development of community services and the operationalization of programs in the unincorporated areas of New Brunswick through Local Services Managers. (p. 41)\nLocal government in New Brunswick is a highly-varied topic; some communities are shrinking while others are growing, which means that one single approach isn't suitable. Furthermore, large areas of the province are not incorporated into cities/towns/villages, as this map from Wikipedia shows.\nThe biggest program spending components for this department are \"local service district expenditures\" and \"community funding and equalization grant for municipalities and rural communities\". This article has some discussion of the equalization grant, although the total seems different from what is in the budget ($75M vs $68M, unless a different line item is included that I'm missing).\nProvincial property taxes are budgeted for $515M in 2017. This is an issue that really affects local communities. This article explores some of the challenges that small businesses face from commercial property taxes.\nI've got to wrap this post up soon, but local government topics in NB certainly could handle further consideration.\n(For a look into another department, I discussed some things relevant to Energy and Resource Development at the end of this post).\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a brief review of a board game I got recently.\nI backed the campaign for the board game Privateer, on Kickstarter, back in December 2013. After a 3 year wait, it finally arrived, and had some chances to play it over the holidays. In my opinion it was worth the wait: it's an enjoyable, well-balanced game.\nThe board is a grid map of the western Caribbean, showing the ports of Catalina, Havana*, Cartagena, Tortuga*, Caracas, and San Juan. Each player has a ship token that they move around the map, trading between ports or getting into battles. The ships have a captain, selected from randomly-dealt cards at the start of the game, and can receive upgrades in four categories. The four categories are sails (movement speed), crew (odds of success on bounty card draws), cannons (combat strength), and hull (cargo capacity). Each upgrade grants a point towards winning the game; they cost progressively more at higher levels.\n*These ports should be shown on the north sides of their respective islands if my geography is correct (but that would slow down the game with greater distances, so I think some artistic license is allowed).\nEach player's turn starts with drawing a bounty card, which can yield an artifact or curse, or a chance to steal from or trade with other players. Next comes moving on the map (the prevailing wind direction which can be set by certain cards or abilities affects your speed). Finally, depending on the square you end on, there may be a battle or the chance to transact trades at a port.\nHere is a view of the board:\nThe colourful spaces at the bottom are for cards that state the prices of various trade goods for each port. Different decks to draw from are placed along the left hand side of the board; the right hand side has a ladder to track victory points (\"Infamy\"). At the top of the photo I've included one of the cards that each player has to track upgrades to their ship.\nHere are some examples of the different types of cards in the game:\nGoing from left to right, starting from the top row, these cards are examples of:\nThe optimal strategy in playing this game will vary depending on your captain's strengths and the upgrades you prioritize (e.g. if you spend a lot on upgrading cargo capacity early in the game, you'll probably be better off avoiding combat). However, a typical game might look like this:\nSome features I like about this game are:\nYou can see more about this game here.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A bit over a year ago, I wrote a post about the mathematics of tiling. In this post, I explore some of those ideas further with an octave script I wrote to draw regular and semi-regular tilings.\nThe script starts by asking for a vertex configuration number (explained here), given as a 1-row matrix (e.g. [4 8 8] for the first image below). The maximum radius to tile is also requested. After checking that the interior angles add up to 360°, a unit circle is created, consisting of vectors along each edge of the tiling pattern out to a distance of 1 from the origin. That unit circle is then drawn at a vertex that is in the tiling pattern, starting at the origin; the ends of the vectors are new vertices. After it is drawn, a new vertex is selected, and the unit circle is reflected and redrawn. This procedure is repeated out to the maximum radius selected, then repeated from the origin multiple times so that the random paths will eventually tile the entire space.\nThe script makes use of transformation matrices to rotate vectors and to reflect the unit circle:\nRotation:\nR = [cos(theta) -1*sin(theta); sin(theta) cos(theta)];, where theta is the angle to rotate\nReflection:\nRf = [(rlx^2 - rly^2) (2*rlx*rly); (2*rlx*rly) (rly^2 - rlx^2)], where rlx and rly are the x and y components, respectively, of the reflection line\nHere are three patterns I drew using this script:\nI used a image editing program to add the numbers in the vertex configuration around the origin; the vectors between the printed numbers comprise the unit circle used in the script.\nThe script runs very slowly (because it goes through over 1000 iterations for a pattern with 5 tiles around each vertex and a radius of 4). It could probably be improved with further work (e.g. a more methodical approach to avoid traversing the same path multiple times like it does in this stochastic approach).\nOne of the tilings I tried, 3.3.3.4.4, did not draw the proper pattern. My assumption is that reflecting the unit circle between vertices is not the correct approach in that case—maybe a certain rotation would work instead, but I don't know for sure. This particular tiling has a different symmetry than the other ones I tried, so that is probably related to it not working from the same script.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about an alternative to taking your car into the repair shop when the check engine light comes on.\nSix years ago, I bought an on-board diagnostic (OBD) interface tool (you'll find them for sale on Ebay, Amazon, etc. if you search for \"elm327 obd2 to usb\") that enables connecting a laptop to the on board computer of a car. Once connected, it's possible to read and clear trouble codes—and do many other things that are more complicated should you wish to do so. I recently used it again when my sister's car had the check engine light on, so I thought it would be a good topic to post about.\nThe interface tool plugs into a port that is somewhere on the driver's side footwell in most cars, I think:\nOnce it's plugged in to the car (which should have the ignition turned to \"ON\"; I'm not sure if it actually needs to be running) and to my laptop, I communicate with it using a serial console session on Linux. This video has a tutorial on doing this. The command to launch the session is sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400, where 38400 is the baud rate.\nOnce in communication with the on-board computer (which can take patience as it can be kind of slow), there are numerous commands you can send; they are mainly in the form of one or two 2-digit hexadecimal numbers: a mode which may be followed by a PID.\nCommon commands include 01 01 to retrieve the number of active trouble codes, 03 to request the codes, and 04 to reset the check engine light. Here is a typical session, followed by interpretation:\nI've shown this as separate lines, but in my session incoming data just keeps overwriting the first line. The numbers in square brackets thus get hidden by the prompt (>) character. The commands used follow what was mentioned in the previous paragraph. Each response begins by echoing the command entered, with 40* added. In the first response this echo is 41 01, for example. It is followed by 83, where apparently the 80* means the check engine light is on and the 3 indicates that there are 3 active trouble codes. I'm not sure of the meaning of the rest of that line. The second response, following the echo 43, shows what those trouble codes are: 04 41, 04 42, and 04 46. The third response, 44, simply acknowledges that the trouble codes have been cleared.\n*These uses of 40 and 80 seem less arbitrary when you convert from hexadecimal to binary\nTo interpret the trouble codes (e.g. 04 41, 04 42, and 04 46), consult the table below, then search online for the meaning of that code. For example, 04 42 becomes P0442, which is interpreted as \"Evaporative Emission Control System Leak Detected (Small Leak)\" according to this forum post. Once you know what the problem is, you can search how to fix it yourself, or call around to get competitive quotes from different repair shops.\nThe ELM327 manual has been my main reference for understanding the codes to send and receive. Here are some additional ones that it lists beyond what I've already used above:\nMode 01 is a request to show current data and has many PIDs (e.g. 05 for engine coolant temperature) to clarify which data is sought; modes 03 and 04 can be called on their own (without a PID) because they don't need any clarification.\nWikipedia has a more comprehensive list of OBD2 modes and PIDs (you really need to know what you're doing to interpret most of these).\nAnother random vehicle tip that I'll finish this post with is that I used to have a lot of frustration from my car doors freezing shut in the winter. This winter I applied some synthetic grease (after checking that it was compatible with metal and rubber and wouldn't freeze) with a rag to the top inside edge of the doors (where they contact the weatherstripping). I haven't had problems with them freezing since then.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Continuing from last week's retrospective post, I wanted to look at a few more posts that I wrote last year; I left them out of the discussion in the previous post because they have overlapping themes that made it logical to discuss them together.\nThe posts referred to in the introduction comprise reviews of the books The End of Doom and Free Market Environmentalism for the Next Generation, and the documentary series Earth: A New Wild. I've included brief descriptions below, but check out the full reviews at the links if you're interested.\nThe first book, by Ron Bailey, discusses positive trends and offers an alternative perspective to fears (and the precautionary principle) about emerging technologies. In the conclusion, he writes:\nThe end of the world is not nigh. Far from it. Humanity does face big environmental challenges over the course of the coming century, but the bulk of the scientific and economic evidence shows that most of the trends are positive or can be turned in a positive direction by further enhancing human ingenuity.\nA recent article that Ron Bailey wrote touches on some technologies to watch—such as Bitcoin, which may be of interest to some of my readers—for their potential to improve life.\nThese notes by astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield also highlight some positive trends.\nThe second book, edited by Dr. Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, brings an economic perspective to environmental issues. Its themes include: that environmental problems are really disputes between people about their preferred use of resources; that there is no ideal environmental baseline to get back to, because the environment is not static; making a link between dynamic environmental processes and dynamic economic processes; finding win-win compromises (instead of win-lose) on contentious issues; that sustainability requires tangible benefits to be secure (and thus truly sustainable); and an examination of the origin of novel property rights and prerequisites for markets.\nFree Market Environmentalism for the Next Generation mentions the Freshwater Trust in Oregon. Its president, Joe Whitworth, gave the following TEDx talk:\nIn it, he talks about his organization's experience increasing the pace and scale of stream restoration projects by harnessing new technology and tapping economic investment by quantifying environmental benefits. This kind of solutions-oriented mindset seems quite optimistic to me. Joe Whitworth has a book called Quantified: Redefining Conservation for the Next Economy, that is on my list to read (and likely review on this blog) this year.\nThe documentary series that I reviewed (and would like to watch again before too long) included a number of stories of people and wildlife coexisting successfully. And just generally showed that the natural world does not have to be a world devoid of people.\nHaving looked back at things I wrote last year, I plan to move on to some new content in my next post. I have some ideas to write about DIY projects, board games, book reviews, outdoor adventures, and more. So stay tuned!\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is the third entry in a 3-part series on the book of Proverbs and the Analects.\nAs mentioned in the previous posts in this series, I'll wrap it up by looking at what Solomon and Confucius had to say about governing a just society.\nAn aspect of good government that Confucius emphasizes is that the ruler himself should be righteous—leading by example:\nThe Master said, \"When a prince's personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without the issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may issue orders, but they will not be followed.\" (13:6)\nLeading by a virtuous example is better than issuing harsh punishments:\nThe Master said, \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame.\n\"If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good.\" (2:3)\n(In fact, Confucius says that capital punishment could be abolished if good men were to govern for a straight century ((13:11))\nMaintaining the confidence of the people should be the foremost priority of the government:\nTsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites of government are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\"\nTsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The military equipment,\" said the Master.\nTsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Master answered, \"Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.\" ((12:7))\nIn addition to maintaining the confidence of the people and leading by example, a ruler should also surround himself with wise and good advisers:\nThe wise are mightier than the strong,\nand those with knowledge grow stronger and stronger.\nSo don’t go to war without wise guidance;\nvictory depends on having many advisers. (Proverbs 24:5-6)\nIt is God’s privilege to conceal things\nand the king’s privilege to discover them.\nNo one can comprehend the height of heaven, the depth of the earth,\nor all that goes on in the king’s mind!\nRemove the impurities from silver,\nand the sterling will be ready for the silversmith.\nRemove the wicked from the king’s court,\nand his reign will be made secure by justice.\nDon’t demand an audience with the king\nor push for a place among the great. (Proverbs 25:2-6, emphasis added)\nWhoever loves a pure heart and gracious speech\nwill have the king as a friend. (Proverbs 22:11)\nThe Duke Ai asked, saying, \"What should be done in order to secure the submission of the people?\" Confucius replied, \"Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.\" (2:19), emphasis added)\nSolomon emphasizes the importance of dispensing impartial justice, not taking bribes or acquitting the guilty, but properly weighing the evidence. His reign should be 'built on justice':\nA king detests wrongdoing,\nfor his rule is built on justice.\nThe king is pleased with words from righteous lips;\nhe loves those who speak honestly.\nThe anger of the king is a deadly threat;\nthe wise will try to appease it.\nWhen the king smiles, there is life;\nhis favor refreshes like a spring rain. (Proverbs 16:12-15)\nConfucius advises rulers to be generous and not oppressive:\nTsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, \"In what way should a person in authority act in order that he may conduct government properly?\" The Master replied, \"Let him honour the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, things;—then may he conduct government properly.\" Tsze-chang said, \"What are meant by the five excellent things?\" The Master said, \"When the person in authority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues what he desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.\"\nTsze-chang said, \"What is meant by being beneficent without great expenditure?\" The Master replied, \"When the person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the things from which they naturally derive benefit;—is not this being beneficent without great expenditure? When he chooses the labours which are proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine? When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with many people or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;—is not this to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;—is not this to be majestic without being fierce?\"\nTsze-chang then asked, \"What are meant by the four bad things?\" The Master said, \"To put the people to death without having instructed them;—this is called cruelty. To require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given them warning;—this is called oppression. To issue orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them with severity;—this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving pay or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;—this is called acting the part of a mere official.\" (20:2)\nSolomon likewise rejects oppression, and stands up for the poor and weak; Proverbs frequently expresses special concern for the poor (see Proverbs 14:31, for example).\nDon’t rob the poor just because you can,\nor exploit the needy in court.\nFor the Lord is their defender.\nHe will ruin anyone who ruins them. (Proverbs 22:22-23)\nSpeak up for those who cannot speak for themselves;\nensure justice for those being crushed.\nYes, speak up for the poor and helpless,\nand see that they get justice. (Proverbs 31:8-9)\nA wicked ruler is as dangerous to the poor\nas a roaring lion or an attacking bear.\nA ruler with no understanding will oppress his people,\nbut one who hates corruption will have a long life. (Proverbs 28:15-16)\nAn interesting Confucian concept is that the ruler should be responsible for the rectification of names; society should be structured in accordance with the truth:\nTsze-lu said, \"The ruler of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\"\nThe Master replied, \"What is necessary is to rectify names.\"\n\"So, indeed!\" said Tsze-lu. \"You are wide of the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\"\nThe Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! A superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a cautious reserve.\n\"If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.\n\"When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.\n\"Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires, is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\" (13:3)\nThe fruit of good government is stability and a growing population:\nWhen there is moral rot within a nation, its government topples easily.\nBut wise and knowledgeable leaders bring stability. (Proverbs 28:2)\nA growing population is a king’s glory;\na prince without subjects has nothing. (Proverbs 14:28)\nThe Duke of Sheh asked about government.\nThe Master said, \"Good government obtains, when those who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are attracted.\" (13:16)\nSince it's Christmas, when we celebrate the birth of a Baby to be the King of kings, I'll end this post with this piece from Handel's Messiah (taken from a passage in Isaiah):\nMerry Christmas to all my readers!\nPermalink",

    "content": "Continuing from last week, this is part two of a planned 3-part series comparing the books of Proverbs and the Analects.\nThe topic of the previous post was on the meaning of being a wise/superior man. This post will cover various advice offered by Solomon and Confucius, and the next one will finish off the series by looking at what they said about governing a just society.\nSolomon and Confucius agree that hard work and foresight are part of the path to success:\nTake a lesson from the ants, you lazybones.\nLearn from their ways and become wise!\nThough they have no prince\nor governor or ruler to make them work,\nthey labor hard all summer,\ngathering food for the winter. (Proverbs 6:6-8)\nThe Master said, \"If a man take no thought about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.\" (15:11)\nI like this Proverb because it illustrates that the ingredients for success and prosperity (e.g. owning oxen) often bring hard, unglamourous work with them (e.g. mucking out a barn):\nWithout oxen a stable stays clean,\nbut you need a strong ox for a large harvest. (Proverbs 14:4)\nAnd Confucius says that even playing games is better than being an idle glutton:\nThe Master said, \"Hard is it to deal with him, who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than doing nothing at all.\" (17:22)\nHowever, even though they promote hard work as leading to prosperity, Solomon and Confucius don't think people should make wealth their main purpose in life:\nThe Master said, \"The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;—even in that there is sometimes want. So with learning;—emolument may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.\" (15:31, emphasis added)\nO God, I beg two favors from you;\nlet me have them before I die.\nFirst, help me never to tell a lie.\nSecond, give me neither poverty nor riches!\nGive me just enough to satisfy my needs.\nFor if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?”\nAnd if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name. (Proverbs 30:7-9)\nVirtue is more important than wealth, and wealth shouldn't be obtained in unethical ways:\nThe Master said, \"Those who are without virtue cannot abide long either in a condition of poverty and hardship, or in a condition of enjoyment. The virtuous rest in virtue; the wise desire virtue.\" ...\nThe Master said, \"Riches and honours are what men desire. If it cannot be obtained in the proper way, they should not be held. Poverty and meanness are what men dislike. If it cannot be avoided in the proper way, they should not be avoided.\n\"If a superior man abandon virtue, how can he fulfil the requirements of that name?\n\"The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.\" (4:2,5)\nPride goes before destruction,\nand haughtiness before a fall.\nBetter to live humbly with the poor\nthan to share plunder with the proud. (Proverbs 16:18-19, emphasis added)\n(In contrast to this Proverb, Confucius thought humility was easier for the rich than I think is generally the case: \"To be poor without murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.\" (14:11)).\nHoarding and charging high interest rates are examples that Solomon gives of the wrong way to get rich:\nPeople curse those who hoard their grain,\nbut they bless the one who sells in time of need. (Proverbs 11:26)\nIncome from charging high interest rates\nwill end up in the pocket of someone who is kind to the poor. (Proverbs 28:8)\nDishonesty in business dealings is another wrong way to get rich:\nThe Lord demands accurate scales and balances;\nhe sets the standards for fairness. (Proverbs 16:11)\n(Along with fraudulent scales, moving boundary stones/survey markers is condemned in Proverbs).\nConversely, honesty—and generally watching your words—is commended by Solomon and Confucius:\nThe mouth of the godly person gives wise advice,\nbut the tongue that deceives will be cut off.\nThe lips of the godly speak helpful words,\nbut the mouth of the wicked speaks perverse words. (Proverbs 10:31-32)\nA gentle answer deflects anger,\nbut harsh words make tempers flare.\nThe tongue of the wise makes knowledge appealing,\nbut the mouth of a fool belches out foolishness. (Proverbs 15:1-2)\nThe Master said, \"The reason why the ancients did not readily give utterance to their words, was that they feared lest their actions should not come up to them.\"\nThe Master said, \"The cautious seldom err.\"\nThe Master said, \"The superior man wishes to be slow in his speech and earnest in his conduct.\" (4:22-24)\nConfucius said, \"There are three errors to which they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to speak;—this is called rashness. They may not speak when it comes to them to speak;—this is called concealment. They may speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;—this is called blindness.\" (16:6)\nAnother aspect of personal character besides honest and edifying speech is sexual fidelity. Proverbs includes strong warnings against adultery. As the son of David, Solomon may have grown up hearing about the consequences and heart-ache that could result from cheating.\nDrink water from your own well—\nshare your love only with your wife.\nWhy spill the water of your springs in the streets,\nhaving sex with just anyone?\nYou should reserve it for yourselves.\nNever share it with strangers.\nLet your wife be a fountain of blessing for you.\nRejoice in the wife of your youth.\nShe is a loving deer, a graceful doe.\nLet her breasts satisfy you always.\nMay you always be captivated by her love.\nWhy be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman,\nor fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman? (Proverbs 5:15-20)\nI appreciate the Proverb above because it is not just a negative warning against adultery, but also a positive celebration of a loving relationship with one's wife. Proverbs has a lot to say about the blessings of a \"virtuous and capable wife\"—most famously in chapter 31—and a harmonious family life.\nA foolish child is a calamity to a father;\na quarrelsome wife is as annoying as constant dripping.\nFathers can give their sons an inheritance of houses and wealth,\nbut only the Lord can give an understanding wife. (Proverbs 19:13-14)\nListen to your father, who gave you life,\nand don’t despise your mother when she is old.\nGet the truth and never sell it;\nalso get wisdom, discipline, and good judgment.\nThe father of godly children has cause for joy.\nWhat a pleasure to have children who are wise.\nSo give your father and mother joy!\nMay she who gave you birth be happy. (Proverbs 23:22-25)\nAlso on the subject of family, Proverbs is perhaps best known—although usually incorrectly quoted—for its admonition not to \"spare the rod\". Confucius doesn't have much to say about corporal punishment, but from what I've heard from Korean and Chinese friends about their upbringing at home and school, I can't imagine he'd be opposed. He was, however, very clear that children should obey and honour their parents diligently; the concept of \"filial piety\" is a big deal in Confucian philosophy:\nMang I asked what filial piety was. The Master said, \"It is not being disobedient.\"\nSoon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master told him, saying, \"Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and I answered him,—'not being disobedient.'\"\nFan Ch'ih said, \"What did you mean?\" The Master replied, \"That parents, when alive, be served according to propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to propriety.\" (2:5)\nIn addition to family, Solomon and Confucius also discuss the importance of friendship, and wisely choosing one’s companions:\nConfucius said, \"There are three friendships which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. Friendship with the upright; friendship with the sincere; and friendship with the man of much observation:—these are advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the glib-tongued:—these are injurious.\" (16:4)\nProverbs says, \"My child, if sinners entice you, turn your back on them! ...\" and Confucius also advises against hanging out with people who aren't interested in righteousness:\nThe Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day, without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;—theirs is indeed a hard case.\" (15:16)\nRather than the company of fools, it is wise to find good mentors:\nTsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. The Master said, \"The mechanic, who wishes to do his work well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any state, take service with the most worthy among its great officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars.\" (15:9)\nGood mentors and true friends will convey wisdom, even when it is not the comfortable or easy thing to do:\nAn open rebuke\nis better than hidden love!\nWounds from a sincere friend\nare better than many kisses from an enemy. (Proverbs 27:5-6)\nThe Master said, \"Can there be love which does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty which does not lead to the instruction of its object?\" (14:8)\nA final bit of life advice from Solomon and Confucius that I'll discuss in this post is exercising moderation/self-control in eating and drinking:\nConfucius said, \"There are three things men find enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they find enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find enjoyment in speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having many worthy friends:—these are advantageous. To find enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of feasting:—these are injurious.\" (16:5, emphasis added)\nSimilarly, Solomon suggests eating honey, but not too much. And he warns about the dangers associated with drinking, but recognizes that wine has its place.\nTo finish off this post, I'll share some pithy sayings of Confucius followed by some excerpts from Proverbs and the Analects that are worth pondering:\nThe Master said, \"Learning without thought is labour lost; thought without learning is perilous.\" (2:15)\nThe Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\" (15:14)\nThere are three things that make the earth tremble—\nno, four it cannot endure:\na slave who becomes a king,\nan overbearing fool who prospers,\na bitter woman who finally gets a husband,\na servant girl who supplants her mistress.\nThere are four things on earth that are small but unusually wise:\nAnts—they aren’t strong,\nbut they store up food all summer.\nHyraxes—they aren’t powerful,\nbut they make their homes among the rocks.\nLocusts—they have no king,\nbut they march in formation.\nLizards—they are easy to catch,\nbut they are found even in kings’ palaces.\nThere are three things that walk with stately stride—\nno, four that strut about:\nthe lion, king of animals, who won’t turn aside for anything,\nthe strutting rooster,\nthe male goat,\na king as he leads his army. (Proverbs 30:21-31)\nThe Master said, \"Yu, have you heard the six words to which are attached six becloudings?\" Yu replied, \"I have not.\"\n\"Sit down, and I will tell them to you.\n\"There is the love of being benevolent without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. There is the love of knowing without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind. There is the love of being sincere without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There is the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to rudeness. There is the love of boldness without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness without the love of learning;—the beclouding here leads to extravagant conduct.\" (17:8)\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is part one of a planned 3-part series comparing the books of Proverbs and the Analects.\nC.S. Lewis wrote that:\nReally great moral teachers never do introduce new moralities: it is quacks and cranks who do that. As Dr. Johnson said, 'People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed.' The real job of every moral teacher is to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see; (Mere Christianity, chap. 3)\nSolomon and Confucius both had much to say about moral principles. King Solomon's reign is dated from 970 – 931 BC. Confucius (Master Kong) lived from 551 – 479 BC on the other side of the Asian continent. In addition to the works discussed in this series on my blog, a Psalm or two are credited to Solomon, as are the books of Ecclesiastes and Song of Solomon in the Bible; Confucius is credited with compiling and contributing to the Five Classics.\nBoth Proverbs and The Analects have a similar style: short pieces of advice or instructive observations. Proverbs is written as instructions to a son, whereas The Analects includes many exchanges between Confucius and various disciples. Solomon's son would be king one day, and Confucius was a government official, so both works contain not only advice on personal ethics, but also on governing a just society. Another common theme is what a good life looks like—being a wise man (not a fool) in Solomon's telling or a superior man in Confucius'.\nThe meaning of wisdom and what it means to be a wise (or superior) man will be the main topic of this first post in the series. Before I get into that, I have a couple of other background items to share:\nThis blog post outlines Confucius' take on social hierarchies: \"make it really clear who the elites are and pay them respect, and tie them to one-on-one relationships with their inferiors that come with corresponding obligations.\"\nConfucianism also had a brief mention in a book on Catholic monasticism I reviewed earlier this year:\nHis long immersion in Confucian learning had brought Ricci to believe profoundly that this was a base onto which, with sensitivity and patience, Christianity could be grafted, much as, centuries earlier, Christianity had been grafted onto Aristotelianism. In the meantime, he advised that missionaries should proceed painstakingly, and not give into the temptation of effecting mass, uninformed conversions. (p. 156)\nProverbs 9 contains competing appeals by wisdom and folly (personified as two women):\nWisdom has built her house;\nshe has carved its seven columns.\nShe has prepared a great banquet,\nmixed the wines, and set the table.\nShe has sent her servants to invite everyone to come.\nShe calls out from the heights overlooking the city.\n“Come in with me,” she urges the simple.\nTo those who lack good judgment, she says,\n“Come, eat my food,\nand drink the wine I have mixed.\nLeave your simple ways behind, and begin to live;\nlearn to use good judgment.”\nversus\nThe woman named Folly is brash.\nShe is ignorant and doesn’t know it.\nShe sits in her doorway\non the heights overlooking the city.\nShe calls out to men going by\nwho are minding their own business.\n“Come in with me,” she urges the simple.\nTo those who lack good judgment, she says,\n“Stolen water is refreshing;\nfood eaten in secret tastes the best!”\nBut little do they know that the dead are there.\nHer guests are in the depths of the grave.\nWhile Folly involves unvirtuous conduct (e.g. stealing) and ends in disaster, Wisdom's path is blessed:\nJoyful is the person who finds wisdom,\nthe one who gains understanding.\nFor wisdom is more profitable than silver,\nand her wages are better than gold.\nWisdom is more precious than rubies;\nnothing you desire can compare with her.\nShe offers you long life in her right hand,\nand riches and honor in her left.\nShe will guide you down delightful paths;\nall her ways are satisfying.\nWisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her;\nhappy are those who hold her tightly. (Proverbs 3:13-18)\nWisdom and folly affect more than the individual:\nA wise child brings joy to a father;\na foolish child brings grief to a mother. (Proverbs 10:1)\nA notable characteristic of a wise person is that they are teachable, unlike the fool:\nA single rebuke does more for a person of understanding\nthan a hundred lashes on the back of a fool. (Proverbs 17:10)\nMoving from Solomon on to Confucius, Book 16 of The Analects has quite a bit to say about the superior man:\nConfucius said, \"There are three things which the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical powers are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are decayed, he guards against covetousness.\"\nConfucius said, \"There are three things of which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands in awe of the words of sages.\n\"The mean man does not know the ordinances of Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of sages.\"\nConfucius said, \"The superior man has nine things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it should be sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is angry, he thinks of the difficulties (his anger may involve him in). When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness.\" (16:7-8,10)\nClearly, good character and conduct are integral to being a superior man. Proverbs mentions the Divine much more than The Analects, but Confucius also does not neglect that aspect of wisdom:\nThe Master said, \"Without recognising the ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.\n\"Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it is impossible for the character to be established.\n\"Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to know men.\" (20:3)\nThe following passages don't specifically use the term \"superior man\", but being a learned or virtuous man is a closely related concept.\nTsze-hsia said, \"If a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his utmost strength; if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:—although men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he has.\" (1:7)\nThis teaching about virtue is interesting because it contains a form of the Golden Rule:\nChung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring against you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will make it my business to practise this lesson.\" (12:2, emphasis added)\nFinally, Confucius instructs us to love truth and virtue, not just know them:\nThe Master said, \"They who know the truth are not equal to those who love it, and they who love it are not equal to those who delight in it.\" (6:18)\nThe Master said, \"I have not seen one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.\" (9:27)\nHere is some musical accompaniment for this post:\nThe next post in this series will go through a variety of the advice offered by Solomon and Confucius. I plan to finish it before Christmas with a look at what they said about governing a society.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This topic of mathematical modelling is something I looked at for a chapter in my thesis, and it is a tool I use in my job. I think it's good to reflect on the capabilities and limitations of the tools we use, so that's what this post attempts to do.\nI'll start with a quote from my thesis (section 6.2):\nModelling is a diverse endeavour, in which different approaches are appropriate depending on the circumstances and purpose to which a model will be applied. Models can be distinguished from each other by a broad range of criteria, including their scale, degree of abstraction and approximation, whether they are intended to be mechanistic or merely descriptive, and whether they include dynamic and probabilistic considerations. Peierls (1980) classified models in physics according to their degree of simplification. The author argued that all types of models can be useful so long as their limitations are recognized and their use is restricted to appropriate circumstances, whether calculations, teaching, or thought experiments. The models presented in this chapter mostly fit in the middle of the categorization scheme of Peierls (1980) as \"Simplifications\" or \"Approximations\" where some features of the phenomenon being studied (nitrification in this case) are omitted to provide clarity or considered negligible enough to ignore. Murthy et al. (1990) provided additional means for classifying models. They divided types of models based on whether they include changes with time and whether they are deterministic or include randomness. Most of the models evaluated below are static and deterministic, although the model of Yang et al. (2008) involves changes with time. Murthy et al. (1990) suggest that models may be further categorized based on the number of independent variables that they use and whether those variables are mathematically discrete or continuous. Dym (2004) emphasized the importance of using a proper level of detail and physical scale when selecting or designing a model.\nIn the course of my research, I considered different models for nitrification in drinking water distribution systems. That involved thinking about some of their different features and characteristics, and level of complexity. In this post, I want to take a more general look at how such features apply to mathematical models in engineering, regardless of the phenomenon they are aimed at. From the paragraph above, and from other notes I took from the linked references (and re-read recently to prepare to write this post), here are some characteristics of models that should be kept in mind when using them:\nThe Peierls (1980) paper has a lot of insight on the appropriate level of simplification or abstraction for a model, which varies depending on the application: even absurd thought experiments and analogies can aid understanding. The following excerpt is from the paper's conclusion:\nWhat is common to all these different types of models is that they serve as aids in thinking more clearly about physical problems, by creating simpler situations, more accessible to our intuition, as steps toward a rational understanding of the actual situation.\nIn choosing the term \"model-making\" in the title, I feared that this might induce thoughts of models railways or model ships. However, on reflection I decided this would not be inappropriate, inasmuch as these also serve to reduce railways or ships to manageable proportions.\nThe book by Dym (2004) describes a model as a representation in mathematical terms of the behaviour of real devices and objects. The stated purpose of modelling is to describe or explain observations, or predict future ones (or events/outcomes). The author advises to match the scale of the model with a suitable level of detail, and not to apply it outside of its valid scale.\nThere is a lot of overlap between statistical forecasting and modelling in engineering, so I referred back to The Signal and the Noise in writing this post. Nate Silver calls overfitting \"the most important scientific problem you've never heard of\" and defines it as \"an overly specific solution to a general problem\" and \"mistaking noise for a signal\" (see p.163). I also like the following passage from that book:\nAs the statistician George E. P. Box wrote, \"All models are wrong, but some models are useful.\" What he meant by this is that all models are simplifications of the universe, as they must necessarily be. As another mathematician said, \"The best model of a cat is a cat.\" Everything else is leaving out some sort of detail. How pertinent that detail might be will depend on exactly what problem we're trying to solve and on how precise an answer we require. (p.230, emphasis and links added)\nThe Signal and the Noise also has a discussion (in the context of climate change models) about how much complexity is suitable in a model. More complexity is justified when the underlying mechanisms are understood* (i.e. if it is a mechanistic model rather than a black box, as distinguished above). However, statistician Scott Armstrong still warns that, \"the more complex you make the model, the worse the forecast gets\" (p.388). But Nate Silver notes that you need enough complexity, which can be a judgement call.\n*I'd give the Activated Sludge Model family that laid the foundation for many wastewater treatment process models as a good example of a somewhat complex model that is justified by its mechanistic nature.\nIn conclusion, getting the scale, level of simplification, and complexity of a model right is highly important and requires good judgement. A good model will find a balance between accuracy and usefulness. Proper validation and avoiding unneccessary complexity can guard against over-fitting.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about a very unique movie trailer.\nA new movie called Lion comes out today. It stars Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman. I heard about it from my girlfriend and it looks like it might be really good. Here is the [conventional] trailer:\nHowever, what I actually want to draw attention to is an unconventional trailer I saw for it this week, and an intriguing new medium for storytelling.\nLion is about a boy, Saroo Brierly, who is adopted from India to Tasmania. When he grows up, he uses Google Earth to search for his birth home and family. (Google Earth has been around longer than the decade mentioned in my title, but I doubt the imagery in India was good enough for this kind of a search until more recently; the movie is based on events that took place in 2011). If you open Google Earth right now, there is an interactive trailer for Lion—it basically provides a virtual tour, with interpretive pop-up windows and pictures, that is a greatly-condensed version of Saroo's search for his birth family.\nThe placemarks and caption windows in Google Earth tell the story quite effectively and touchingly, I found. It made me wonder what other stories would work well in this medium. I also think that more movies and books should come with companion geodata. (I have made my own companion geodata for a couple of book reviews, and I'm reading a book now that I'd like to do something similar for).\nHere are a few screenshots from this interactive trailer in Google Earth, although I encourage you to check out the whole thing:\nI've also extracted the initial part (the first few placemarks, which take 250 lines) of the .kml file for this trailer, below. Maybe it would be a useful template for someone else to tell a story in this medium...\nPermalink",

    "content": "My apologies for not having a post last week. My job is very busy these days, and on top of that I was on the road last week. I've got some good ideas to write about before the end of the year—hopefully I can find the time. This week's post, however, is just a topical article I wanted to share.\nThe US election is mercifully over (although of course many people are displeased with the outcome). As a result, much of what has been written on the internet over the past 6+ months is now of rapidly-fading relevance. It makes me glad that this isn't a political blog.\nA while back I shared this article on Facebook from FEE.org; I think it's worth re-sharing here and now. Hopefully, as people dial back the intense level of attention to politics that many get into during election campaigns and try to resume their regular interests*, this is a helpful reminder that there is more to life than politics and more to society than government.\nHere are a couple of excerpts:\nThe message that politics beats into our heads hourly is that your neighbor might be your enemy, and that the realization of your values requires the crushing of someone else’s.\nThat’s a terrible model of human engagement to accept as the only reality. It is demoralizing, and I’ve felt it this year more than ever. But everyone I know says the same thing, even those who are trying their best to tune it out.\nA slogan passed around some years ago in academic circles was that “the personal is the political.” That sounds like hell on earth. The slogan should be flipped and serve as a warning to all of us: whatever you politicize will eventually invade your personal life. We should not allow this to happen. The less that life is mediated by political institutions, the more the spontaneous and value-creating impulses in our nature come to the fore.\nWhile I am on the topic of the US election, here are some interesting maps of states where third party candidates performed the strongest, and of the strong urban–rural political divide (because maps!).\n*If your interests include anything from mathematical models, to ethics, to ships, to travel, to water quality & treatment, to video games, etc. then stay tuned as I hope to continue writing about these types of things.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I wanted to understand the history of the Middle East better, so I made the following timelines. Hopefully some readers will find them informative, too.\nIf you turn on the news, you can see ancient cities like Aleppo, Sana'a, and Mosul being ravaged by war. The present conflicts did not come out of nowhere—rivalries between Arabs, Turks, Persians, and outside powers have been a recurring feature of the region. Understanding some of the history can make the present a little less mystifying (maybe). Plus it's fascinating in many ways for its own sake.\nHistory occurs in 4 dimensions; it has spatial and time-based aspects. This makes it hard to visualize. In this post, I've drawn timelines for a number of different cities stretching from North Africa to Central Asia and placed them in parallel. This allows seeing what was going on along the shores of the Mediterranean at the same time Genghis Khan was pushing through Central Asia, for example.\nTo orient the following timelines, here is a key map (adapted from a file on Wikimedia) showing the locations of the cities I used:\nI tried to pick cities that have long histories (so places like Dubai and Tel Aviv didn't make the cut). Some of the timelines also include a few events from nearby places (e.g. Kairouan with Tunis, Kufa with Baghdad, Rey with Tehran, Bukhara with Samarkand).\nThe timelines start with the assassination of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib in 661 A.D. and the subsequent start of the Umayyad Caliphate ('Ali was the fourth and last Rashidun Caliph, while the Umayyads had the first dynastic caliphate). They end with the end of World War One and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire around 1920.\nFor each city, I've included the timeline followed by some links to people, places, events, etc. that were mentioned; general reference pages are linked in a section at the end. My source for this post was Wikipedia.\nI made the timelines using Inkscape, as I've done for some other infographics on my blog (see 1, 2, 3). I think I uploaded a suitable resolution to read, although you may need to zoom in or open the images in a new tab, especially if you have a small screen.\nThere are a few interesting things I noticed in preparing these timelines:\nI could have included more cities, but I think I achieved decent coverage with the ones I selected.\nPermalink",

    "content": "For this week's post I made a .gif showing how the water level in the Bay of Fundy changes with the tides over the course of a day.\nThe data came from the Fisheries and Oceans Canada tide predictions; zones 30, 31, and 32 cover the Bay of Fundy. Here is a map showing sites with tidal predictions available (I pasted the three zone maps together to show the whole Bay):\nFor a number of sites around the bay, I collected the hourly predicted water levels into a table. This data is for October 16th, which was a full moon and therefore a \"spring tide\". The water levels are in metres.\nTo make the following animation, I started with a base map from Wikimedia Commons then marked the water elevation from each site at its appropriate location. I also showed the direction of Reversing Falls and when the tidal bore arrives in Moncton. I made each hour as a separate slide in Powerpoint, exported the slides as images, and then assembled them into a .gif in GIMP.\nTides can be thought of as a wave that circles the earth about twice a day. The cycle is a bit more than twelve hours. Therefore, the animation doesn't match up smoothly when the day ends; also, each day is different, so check the official tide times before heading out—don't assume they will be the same as in this graphic.\nStrong tidal currents can be expected in areas where the level changes dramatically or where there is a relatively steep elevation gradient between nearby places. Scots Bay / Cape Split (the bottleneck of the Minas Basin) is an example of this. It would be an interesting place to go hiking and see the ocean.\nSomething that could improve this graphic is if I colour-coded the spot elevations to show the height in a more intuitive manner (and/or added contours).\nWhile I'm talking about Fundy, I thought I'd share a few photos from a recent trip to Fundy National Park:\nAlma harbour:\nDickson Falls, with a moss-covered rock in the foreground:\nA boardwalk on the trail to Dickson Falls:\nFinally, here are some links to previous posts that I've made .gifs for: 1, 2, 3.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is about one of the DIY projects hinted at in my previous post: an indoor air quality filter.\nActivated carbon can adsorb volatile compounds (such as odours)—see the discussion here. I wanted to rig up a means of blowing air past an activated carbon filter; it could then be left in a room to recirculate and purify the air (at least in theory).\nTo move the air, I had a 5V computer cooling fan. Because it was only 5V, it could conveniently be powered off of USB. A USB cable contains 4 wires:\nThe activated carbon filter came in the form of a mesh bag. I got it from a pet store as it is commonly used in aquarium filters. It fit snugly into a 40 mm pipe.\nTo connect the fan with the length of pipe holding the activated carbon, I designed a manifold for the fan and had it 3D printed. I've uploaded the file to Thingiverse.\nTo fit the fan in, I had to trim off the holder tabs and shave some of the sides down just a bit, but once it was in it fit securely.\nHere are a couple of pictures (sorry about the low image quality this time):\nThe first image shows the power leads of the fan being connected to the power and ground wires of the USB cable. I stripped the ends of the wires then twisted and soldered them together, red to red and black to black (the green and white data channels were not needed). I definitely still need to practice soldering, but I think I'm improving.\nThe next image shows the completed project. The black length of pipe behind the blue 3d-printed manifold is stuffed with a bag of activated carbon.\nWith the low power of the fan and the tight packing of activated carbon, I think there might be too much of a pressure drop to really get much airflow through the filter. But I'm still going to run it periodically in case it does have a benefit.\nIf you make this, do so at your own risk. Heed the warnings on soldering tools and be aware of the risks of shock and fire from DIY electrical connections.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A week ago, I was having fun on Prince Edward Island so I didn't have time to blog. For this week, I thought I'd post about 3D printing since it's been awhile since I've done so.\nIn a recent post I mentioned that I had a couple of DIY projects planned. As part of these projects, I designed some components and tried to make them on my 3D printer.\nHowever, as seen in the image below, the filament jammed:\nThe tip is partially melted, but higher up the filament there is a part that looks like it got compressed simply from being pushed through a constrained opening. Further up (not visible), the filament was worn down from the feeder cog. This has happened before since the time that I replaced the extruder nozzle, so I'm starting to think that I didn't get the installation quite right.\nRather than face the frustration (with no guarantee it would work anyway) of trying to re-fix my 3D printer at this time, I decided to turn again to 3D printing as a service. I used 3D Hubs as I did before; it worked out great.\nHere are the components that I received, above. The two small pieces in front are for a telescope (previously mentioned) and the larger piece in the box is for a fan. I plan to share the results when I get them assembled.\nAlso on the topic of 3D printing, I noticed that some tiles that I shared an .stl file for now have a couple of nice \"makes\" with photos on Thingiverse: 1, 2.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Long weekends are a good time to get out and explore. This past weekend, I managed to get out biking, hiking, and kayaking (a different activity each day!) in places I hadn't been before.\nI went biking on Saturday along a section of trail from Keswick Landing to Burtt's Corner, along the Keswick River.\nThe trail is used by snowmobiles in the winter. Apparently there is a connecting trail that goes to Durham (see this map from the NB Federation of Snowmobile Clubs).\nOn Sunday, I went hiking with a friend. We climbed to a lookout tower on Montagne des Therrien (possibly also known as Mont Pointu) in Riviere-Verte. There were a few different trails, but we did a loop that ended up being around 2 km.\nThe view was well worth it, and will likely be even better in a few weeks as the leaves change colours.\nThe mouth of the Meduxnekeag River is a spot I've been wanting to go kayaking; I got there on Monday and it did not disappoint. There are many shallow places and tiny islands starting about 500 metres from where it flows into the Saint John River. So it has aspects of a wetland—including plenty of birds. I saw an eagle, an osprey, a heron, some red-winged blackbirds (I think), and plenty of ducks (I'd guess at least two varieties, but I'm not sure) and Canada geese.\nHere are some geese in flight:\nThere are public docks in Woodstock NB by the information centre/craft market and behind the NBCC campus that are convenient for exploring this section of river.\nI'm not sure how much longer the weather will be suitable for these kinds of activities—hopefully at least a couple more months—but I have no shortage of ideas for next year and beyond:\nLikely hiking or kayaking at at least some of these places would provide some good blogging material.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post was 8 years in the making, in a way. It is a woodworking project I started in 2008*, but didn't finish before I left for my master's studies. I found the pieces that I had cut and drilled and stained, and decided to finish it.\n* The year 2008 explains why I was building a stand for CDs.\nHere are the pieces that I found that had already been cut and drilled and stained. The larger diameter dowels are upright support columns and the small dowels with the darker stain will actually hold the CDs. I remember that drilling evenly spaced holes straight into the centre of the larger dowels took some care.\nThe small dowels span between the upright columns. It took a few extra hands to get them all lined up and inserted into the glue-filled holes! Each side of the open triangle was clamped and allowed to cure over night; the small dowels had to tie the columns together as well as supporting the CDs.\nThe base to support the stand was two pieces of unstained maple, glued together with the aid of a wafer piece. The upright columns were screwed to the base through countersunk holes on the underside.\nFinally, here is the finished stand holding a few discs. The one on the bottom was the subject of my previous post.\nHere's a link to a woodworking project I wrote about a couple of years ago. I also have a couple of other DIY projects planned, so stay tuned for those.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a review of Earth: A New Wild, a nature documentary series.\nEarth: A New Wild is a five-episode series produced by PBS and National Geographic. I have it on BluRay disc. The National Geographic website includes this description:\nThe series features spectacular natural history footage from the most striking places on Earth, filming encounters between wild animals and the people who live and work with them. With up-close looks at a range of species, from giant pandas to humpback whales and African lions to Arctic reindeer, Sanjayan reveals that cohabitations with animals can work—and be mutually beneficial. Distinguishing itself from nearly all other nature films, however, the series turns the cameras around, showing the world as it really is—with humans in the picture. (emphasis added)\nThere are a lot of interesting nature documentaries out there, but I find this one interesting because of the way it incorporates the human element. It is hosted by Dr. M. Sanjayan. He seems like a fun guy, as some of the episodes show him kayaking, horseback riding, or paragliding to interact with wildlife.\nSome of the themes of this documentary series are ways in which people can learn to live alongside wildlife with less conflict, the importance of predators (and even of grazing), and the beneficial services provided by ecosystems. An interesting example of the latter is vultures in India eating carcasses and thus indirectly controlling disease—as people discovered the hard way when the vulture population declined.\nEarth: A New Wild has episodes on Oceans, Plains, and Forests, among others. The episode about Plains is probably my favourite. It raises the idea that, notwithstanding concerns about overpopulation, healthy grasslands actually depend on having large herds of grazers moving about: they break up hard soil with their hooves, spread seeds around, and leave manure as fertilizer. The key is that they can't stay in the same location for too long or it will get overgrazed. This is where predators (or cowboys, in the case of domesticated herds) come in. By keeping grazers on the move, they keep plains ecosystems in balance. A concrete example of this is when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park. Elk had been spending a lot of time on the riverbanks, stripping vegetation bare and increasing erosion; once they had a predator to fear again, they stayed on the move and the riverbank vegetation had a chance to recover. Similar stories pop up in the other episodes too.\nThe episode about Oceans included the incredibly memorable phrase, \"The Rise of Slime.\" This refers to the fact that the populations of large predators (especially sharks) have been depleted while algae has proliferated—the stock of biomass in the oceans is now over-represented at the bottom of the food chain.\nOne thing I liked about this series was that it included a number of stories of people and wildlife coexisting successfully. Some interesting ones were cork forests in Portugal that are commercially productive and biodiverse, water wells dug by herders in the African savanna that sustain wildlife after the cattle have moved on, and South American tribes using GPS to record inventories of species while documenting their own property rights.\nHere are a few of the places featured in Earth: A New Wild:\nI'll conclude with the monologue that introduces each episode:\nThe wilds of planet earth are spectacular. Yet one species is always missing from the picture: us. I'm Dr. M. Sanjayan. As a scientist and conservationist, I've dedicated the past 25 years of my life to studying and protecting the wildlife I love. Now, my mission is to tell you an untold story, where we humans are not separate from nature—we are part of it.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This weekend, I went on a short sea kayaking tour in the Bay of Fundy.\nRed Rock Adventure in St. Martin's, New Brunswick, offers sea kayaking tours and other outdoor adventures. It's a great spot to get out on the water as it has a quaint harbour, some sea caves, and imposing sandstone cliffs to admire. I went out on a 2 – 3 hour tour (including a stop on a secluded beach). The tour guides pointed out some of the birds in the area (e.g. sandpipers and piping plovers) and other interesting facts and features; they also provided a snack of crackers with smoked salmon, goat cheese, cucumber, and avocado.\nOne of my friends came with me and wore a Garmin GPS watch. Our tandem kayak travelled almost 8 km and briefly reached a top speed > 11 km/h. The elevation data from the GPS was fascinating: we were at an elevation of 46 feet when we left the harbour and 26 feet when we returned. Since only about 2 hours had elapsed, this decrease of 20 feet does not even represent the full tidal span in St. Martin's. The harbour was actually too muddy to land the kayaks at the lower water elevation, so we ended up landing on a beach.\nI've previously mentioned the Fundy tides in a post on waves & beaches.\nHere are some photos of this little excursion:\nStarting out from the harbour on a calm morning:\nTaking a break on a beach—this is looking back the way we came, and shows the sandstone cliffs:\nThe beach where we landed (the tides have left a number of gravel berms at different levels):\nThe tide had gone out in the harbour when we got back (compare this to the first photo, where a boat at the same wharf is still mostly floating):\nBonus links:\nPermalink",

Their guild has pledged to remain neutral between various political factions, performing warrants for anyone willing to pay. However, the main characters get progressively more drawn into things; both the crew and the guild have hidden depths as well.\nDark Matter begins with the crew of a spaceship waking up from life support pods with no memories but plenty of skills (i.e. basically they are six Jason Bournes). They try to discover who they really are, while staying ahead of people hunting them or items stowed aboard the ship.\nThey are both in their second seasons now, but here are the original trailers to avoid any spoilers:\nPermalink",

    "content": "I was inspired to learn more about the history of religious orders after visiting an abbey in Scotland and while planning a trip to France. I read a book called The Lord as Their Portion: The Story of the Religious Orders and How They Shaped Our World by Elizabeth Rapley; this post is based on things I learned from it and from travelling (augmented by Wikipedia). My apologies for not having a post last week: it's been a busy time with my job, including a few days on the road\np.s. Here is another link related to my previous post.\nThe title of this post comes from the fact that a number of places in the U.K. are named after religious orders that had a presence nearby (e.g. Blackfriars Bridge in London).\nThe Lord as Their Portion (abbreviated TLATP below) by Elizabeth Rapley covers the history of Catholic religious orders. It is mainly focused on continental western Europe (especially France and Italy—which are where many of the most prominent orders started) so Celtic monasticism and the Desert Fathers are only discussed in passing; Dr. Rapley is a Canadian and remarks that she wishes she had more space to discuss the history of religious orders in this country. She gives relatively equal coverage to female orders, but this post would be way too long if I got into that. Because of the importance of the Church in western European history, I found that this book mentioned a lot of the important historical events and developments there to put the history of the religious orders in context.\nThe introduction summarizes the development of Catholic religious orders in western Europe:\nWhen, inch by inch, western Europe emerged from its Dark Ages, much of its developing dynamism came from them. There was nothing they did not turn their hand to. The building and adornment of churches and cathedrals, the copying and illumination of the written word, the development of new techniques in agriculture and animal husbandry: all these achievements bore their imprint. Then, as society matured and settled down, their services expanded and became more complex. They preached, taught, nursed the sick, championed the poor. Above all they explored, and advanced, the faith. ...\nIt was close to a millennium after the birth of Jesus Christ before the germ of a religious order — a collection of monasteries that owed allegiance, in feudal fashion, to one supreme abbot — appeared. This was Cluny. After that things moved faster. Within two hundred years, a sort of federal system was worked out, in which participating monasteries remained independent but accepted correction from each other, and oversight by a central abbot in concert with a general chapter. With that, a true religious order came into being. This was the Cistercian order, the model many subsequent orders would come to imitate. ...\nThen, in the thirteenth century, there appeared a new tribe of religious persons, the friar. Consciously, audaciously, these men took their religious life into the world, contending that God is served best when prayer is combined with the saving of souls, in what they called \"the mixed life.\" (pp. ix – xi)\nOne thing that wasn't clear to me before I read TLATP was some of the\nterminology around religious orders: What are the distinctions between hermits, monks, friars/mendicants, clerks, and canons?\nMonasteries, as expressions of the aspirations of the medieval world, had been built on the principle of flight from the world; friaries, responding to the changing spirit of the high Middle Ages, were built within the world, but also served as sanctuaries to which their members could withdraw, though temporarily, from its entanglements. Divine office and community life were seen as antidotes to the contamination that came from association with the world. Now a new form of religious life was to develop, which was ready to engage more aggressively with the world. \"Leaving God for God\" would be its rallying cry. ...\nAnd so charitable confraternities appeared in several Italian cities: centers called \"oratories\" where clergy and laity — men and women — joined together to deepen their spiritual life with communal prayer while, at the same time, ministering to the poor...\nThese men came to be known as \"clerks regular\". (p. 127 – 128, emphasis added)\nCanons and hermits aren't mentioned in this particular excerpt. Unlike monks (especially those sticking to the original Rule of Benedict), canons were all priests and not cloistered since they had duties in the community under the direction of their bishop. Moreover, most did not take vows of poverty. Hermits lead more solitary lives, although some are members of religious orders.\nOver time, a lot of the boundaries between these different types of religious orders blurred (e.g. mendicant orders no longer stuck to itinerant lifestyles, and monks took on more community engagement). In general, members of the religious orders take 3 vows: poverty, chastity, and obedience (to a superior)—although there are many variations.\nThe Rule of St. Benedict was one of the first to be widely adopted. Ora et labora (pray and work) is a motto that sums up this mode of monastic life.\nGiven the future history of Christian monasticism, it is important to note that Benedicts's monks were not expected to be useful to society, either by teaching or by preaching or even by intercessory prayer.\nMonte Cassino and Cluny are important Benedictine abbeys. Cluny received vast donations to pray for donors.\nThe Benedictine Order is known as Black Monks due to the colour of their habits.\nThe Cistercian order is one that I find most interesting, because of their influence and legacy. They had innovations in governance (an early example of an effective international organization), metallurgy (mentioned in a book I read on the Industrial Revolution), and agriculture:\n[The Cistercians] were not only good farmers, they were good farmers who did not consume all they produced. As long as the Cistercians kept to their austere way of life, they found themselves with surpluses. It did not take long for these surpluses to make their way into the market, first of grain, and then of wool. (p. 27)\nI've been to two Cistercian sites: Citeaux (near Dijon) and Melrose in the Scottish Borders. The former established the Clos Vougeot vineyard and the latter was active in the wool trade.\nThey were known as white monks (not to be confused with whitefriars, which are Carmelites).\nLater on, the Trappists (famous for their cheeses these days) split off from the Cistercian order.\nDominicans, also known as Blackfriars, were founded by St. Dominic. He was a great speaker and debater, and the order focused on preaching, informed by study. They were active in early European universities and had many notable scholars in their ranks; St. Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican.\nThe order started as canons, but became friars.\nTLATP includes a pun about the Dominicans: Domini canes = the hounds of the Lord. This is in reference to their role in the Inquisition. One thing that occurred to me while reading this book is that each order had its own strengths and distinctive emphases, and many of them developed weaknesses corresponding to their strengths. In the case of the Dominicans, they were noted for their intellect, doctrinal correctness, and zeal, and went on to participate in the Inquisition.\nThe Dominicans (and Cistercians) were also involved in the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars.\nThe Franciscans, also known as Greyfriars, were founded by St. Francis of Assisi. He was widely respected for his commitment to poverty among other reasons, which set the tone for the order.\nThe Capuchins (whose habit gave the name to a type of monkey) are an offshoot of the Franciscan order.\nThe Rule of St. Augustine was applicable for community life for canons (i.e. ordained clergy). There are both canons (canons regular) and friars known as Augustinians. Martin Luther was an Augustinian friar.\nThe Jesuits were established later than many of the other prominent orders. They're an order of clerks regular. Their activities as court confessors and in running schools (training many members of courts) gave them a reputation for secretly running society. They were actually suppressed (except in Prussia and Poland and Russia) from 1773 – 1814. Some of the early Jesuits were famous missionaries to Asia.\nHere are some monasteries I visited in France:\nCiteaux Abbey today. The relief carving on the left reads \"faites tout ce qu'il vous dira\" (Mary's instructions to the servants at Cana), I think.\nAt Citeaux Abbey, there is a walk with seals in the ground illustrating the conditions of the monastery over the centuries. This one reads \"Ora, lege, et labora\" (pray, read, work).\nThis is the Jacobins' (an alternative name for Dominicans in France) cloister in Toulouse.\nThis is an Augustinian cloister in Toulouse. It is now an art museum.\nFinally, here are a few other interesting facts from TLATP, along with related ideas I've had about monks:\nPermalink",

Three years ago (as of last month), before I started writing this blog, I went to Spain. This post is a look back at that trip.\nMy visit to Spain started (and ended) in Madrid. It was my first time being on my own in a truly foreign city, and it ended up being a great experience. I enjoyed seeing some interesting neighbourhoods, plazas, parks, and museums. I remember getting some tasty food at the Mercado de San Miguel. At the Reina Sofia art gallery, I saw lots of works by Salvador Dali and other Spanish artists and at the Naval museum I saw scale models of ships and ports from the glory days of the Spanish empire, along with naval artifacts. I wanted to go to the National Archaeology Museum but it was closed for renovations when I was there. Although I only went to the Reina Sofia Madrid also has a couple of other prominent art galleries: the Prado and the Thyssen-Bornemisza. If I was in the area again, I'd also like to take a day trip (or overnight) to Toledo to see its medieval city centre.\nThis photo is of the Iglesia de San Pedro el Viejo in the La Latina neighbourhood.\nFrom Madrid I moved on to Grenada, which I absolutely loved. In Granada, the medieval neighbourhood of Albaicin and the fortress/palace complex of Alhambra stand on opposing hills. I stayed in a cool hostel in the Albaicin (which took a while to find due to the narrow, twisting streets and alleys); they gave a walking tour one day when I was there that went to a solar-powered dance party in the woods and a gypsy village in the caves outside the city walls (it's a pretty well-established part of the city now).\nThe Albaicin and Alhambra are shown in the photos below, followed by a picture from inside the Alhambra—in the palace portion. It was built by the Moors and is famous for the carvings and tiles on the walls and doors (I've shown a picture of a tiling pattern there in a previous post).\nThe weather was fantastic when I was there. And I enjoyed some tea shops. I'd like to go back to that part of Spain (Andalusia) and see some other places there (Seville, Cordoba, etc.); Granada is definitely a spot I'd love to return to, too.\nAfter Grenada I took a bus to Algeciras. It's not really a tourist destination; I went there to catch a ferry to Tangier, across the Strait of Gibraltar in Morocco. However, I still found a few things of interest there, such as its large container port (I like watching ships) and views of the rock of Gibraltar (pictured below). And I had a nice walk along the water after I got back from Morocco. If I was going there again, I'd want to visit Gibraltar (i.e. the British side).\nThe ferry ride across the Strait of Gibraltar was pretty quick, going from Tarifa (a shuttle bus connected from the larger ferry terminal in Algeciras) to downtown Tangier. I spent a day and a night in Morocco, getting shown around by a guide who basically attached himself to me from the time I left the ferry (and demanded payment at the end of the day—it was kind of a stressful experience, but I got to see quite a bit of the city in a short amount of time). In Tangier, I visited some merchants in the old medina and ended up buying a Berber rug and a couple of shirts. I also saw some markets, mansions, and historic buildings in the city, and the cave of Hercules just outside of it.\nHere are a couple of photos from Tangier: a public square, and looking over some rooftops in the old medina.\nBack in Spain, I took an overnight bus from Algeciras to Valencia, where I met up with a friend of mine who was on an exchange program at the university there. Valencia has a nice linear park that follows the course of an old river bed (the river was diverted to save the city from floods). It also has beautiful beaches. The City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia has some striking contemporary architecture. If I'd been there longer, it would have been nice to visit the Oceanografic aquarium. We also went to the cathedral (its bell tower offered a panorama of the entire city) and the central market. I enjoyed some delicious food in Valencia: paella, horchata, and a variety of tapas—my friend speaks Spanish a lot better than I do, and knew the best things to order, so I ate better there than in other cities where I was depending on myself to order.\nHere are a couple of photos of the City of Arts and Sciences:\nTo wrap up this post, here is a photo of some tasty jamón being sold in Valencia's central market:\nPermalink",

    "content": "As mentioned at the top of my previous post, this post is a book review. It's quite a lengthy post so it took a while to find time to write it; I hope it was worth the wait.\nFree Market Environmentalism for the Next Generation (abbreviated FME below) by Terry Anderson and Donald Leal was published in 2015. Through their research at PERC—the Property and Environment Research Center—in Montana, the authors have spent decades looking at how property rights and markets can be used to promote positive environmental outcomes. Free Market Environmentalism for the Next Generation provides an up-to-date look at their thinking on the topic, backed-up by numerous real-world case studies and some interesting history lessons.\nThe book is divided into ten chapters. Each chapter feels like a university lecture, in terms of its length and content (theory plus a few illustrative case studies). This is not a book you'd take to the beach; but it's not a textbook, either. The first two chapters introduce a lot of the concepts used in the book, such as contrasting political environmentalism with free market environmentalism, and emphasizing the dynamic nature of both environmental and economic processes. Chapter 3 looks at how property rights evolve over time, with notable attention paid to the history of the American West. I found it to be one of the most interesting parts of this book. The next two chapters take a deeper look at public land management in the United States as it relates to forestry (Chapter 4) and energy projects (Chapter 5). Moving from land to water, chapter 6 discusses water markets (which are an emerging approach to managing both quantity and quality) and chapter 7 discusses fishery policy. The book is not dogmatic, but rather offers incremental suggestions for solutions that involve communities (i.e. rather than insist on privatizing everything, they suggest things like moving towards more local management of public lands, fish & wildlife, etc.)—this is the focus of Chapter 8. Finally, Chapter 9 presents examples of some people and organizations that are making a difference with the toolkit the authors recommend, and Chapter 10 reaches into new territory, such as how their ideas could relate to climate change responses.\nNow that I've given an overview of the book's contents, I'll move on to discussing its major themes, some interesting examples, and some thoughts of my own on applications.\nOne of the themes is that environmental problems are really disputes between people about their preferred use of resources:\nAll environmental problems emanate from conflicting demands on limited natural resources.\nWhen human demands are small in comparison to the resource base, conflicts between competing users are less prominent. People were not concerned with waste emissions into the atmosphere when clean air was abundant.\nThis ties into the theme that there is no ideal environmental baseline to get back to, because the environment is not static.\nOnce we accept that nature is profoundly shaped by and connected to human action, we begin to see environmental problems through a different lens. In this view, environmental problems cannot be thought of as simply the consequence of human violations on the balance of nature. A new generation of ecologists has rejected the notion of a natural harmony in ecosystems[*]. Instead, environmental problems become questions of how to resolve competing human demands on nature's ever changing bounty.\n* That is, ecosystems are dynamic and continually changing. They are subject to periodic disturbances and to long-term trends such as coming out of the last ice age 10 – 20 millennia ago, as well as human impacts.\nAs an aside, FME raises the point that settlers migrating westward in North America thought they were seeing pristine wilderness, but the landscapes they were encountering may have been managed by native people more than they realized (e.g. by setting annual fires). I've read another book that agrees with that point, but I don't know if it is a new scholarly consensus. In any case, I liked this suggestion to have:\n\"a more nuanced notion of a global, half-wild rambunctious garden, tended by us\" (Marris, Rambunction Garden)\nThe dynamic, ever-changing nature of, well, nature, is set side by side with the dynamic nature of free markets:\nFor much of the twentieth century, ecologists and economists tended to study the world as if it were an equilibrium system. That is, the models used to understand nature and markets were based on the assumption that each system achieves or exists in balance. Ecologists, for example, historically relied on models that assumed an inherent balance of nature when undisturbed by humans.\nBoth markets and ecosystems are bottom-up systems that cannot be managed from the top down.\nOnce we recognize that most knowledge is fragmented and dispersed, then we can understand that, in the words of Thomas Sowell, \"systemic coordination among the many supersedes the special wisdom of the few\".\nThis link that is drawn between dynamic environmental processes and dynamic economic processes is an important theme in FME.\nAnother theme is the comparison between political environmentalism and free-market environmentalism. In the latter, exchanges based on secure property rights can hopefully find win-win compromises to contentious issues:\nMarkets based on secure property rights provide a decentralized system for enhancing the value of resources. They generate information in the form of prices that give demanders and suppliers objective measures of subjective values.\nIn contrast,\nPolitical environmentalism is a zero-sum game that creates negative-sum conflicts as competing parties attempt to get what they want at the expense of others. Regulations and permits grant access to natural resources to some at the expense of those who are excluded. Addressing external costs through the political process pits interest groups against one another, leaving little room for cooperation. ... Benefits are concentrated on the group with the political clout.\nI'd sum up another theme by the rancher proverb that the authors cite: \"If it pays, it stays\". Especially as it relates to conserving wildlife, they contend that conservation works a lot better when something is seen as a boon rather than a burden to nearby human communities.\nThe final theme of FME that I'll mention is its examination of the origin of novel property rights and prerequisites for markets. In order to have a market, it needs to be feasible to delineate property, define rights to it, and enforce those rights. This is something that has an evolutionary aspect, as new technology may make delineation possible where it wasn't before, or rising demand on an environmental resource may make defining and enforcing rights worthwhile where it wasn't before. This theme is illustrated most memorably in the history of the American West, where rights to grazing land went through several iterations before the invention of barbed wire made fencing (and thus clear delineation) feasible:\nThe problems on the American frontier centered on who owned the land, the cattle, and the water. Out of these problems frontier entrepreneurs developed new [i.e. not an existing part of common law] property institutions to define and enforce rights that improved resource allocation. Those institutions were not perfect, and the demonstrate very well the evolutionary nature of property rights and the potential for innovative property rights solutions on the American frontier as well as in the developing world today.\nThe history of the American frontier is related to conditions in the developing world today, where so much property is undocumented:\nFor the developing world, conditions are not unlike the frontier of the American West. Hernando de Soto estimated that \"the total value of the real estate held but not legally owned by the poor of the Third World and former communist nations is at least $9.3 trillion\".\nBut, lacking legal land title, the productive potential of land in the developing world is locked up. The importance of property rights to business activity and entrepreneurship is demonstrated by the fact that 70 percent of new businesses in the United States are started with loans secured with mortgages. In contrast, such collateral is unavailable in the developing world because 80 percent of the owners lack formal or up-to-date titles.\nMoving into applications, I'll mention some examples (and other interesting things that I learned) from FME then discuss an area where these ideas might be relevant for New Brunswick.\nLooking closer to home, I think some of the ideas presented in FME are worth considering when it comes to Crown Land in New Brunswick. Crown Land covers a lot of the area of the province (just shy of 50%), but from looking at recent provincial budgets I can't see that the province gets a lot of value from it—at least in a direct or quantifiable way. The Department of Natural Resources had revenue of $77.1 million but expenses of $91.7 million in the most recent budget statement (ordinary account numbers; see pages 7 and 8); the Energy and Mines Department also had more expenses than revenue. Crown Land management is also subject to political environmentalism and the divisive debates that go with the winner-take-all approach.\nIn FME, the authors suggest a number of ways to improve public land management: user fees and revenue retention, public private partnerships (e.g. concessions to manage recreation areas), land trusts (blocks of land set aside to be managed to generate revenue for a specific purpose, e.g. schools), and lands that are managed by First Nations bands or local communities. Many of these elements are already present in NB, but could perhaps be expanded. Community forests are being piloted next door in Nova Scotia. Increased private ownership rates could also be considered. If some Crown Land was sold off, prospective owners—woodlot owners large and small, conservation groups (the NB Nature Trust and Nature Conservancy of Canada are already active in owning and managing wild areas), hunters and anglers, etc.—would have to pay market rates (instead of lease rates determined by the department) in competition with other prospective owners/users.\nAll in all, I found this book to offer a unique perspective on some environmental issues. Its strength is the number and variety of examples offered (only some of which I've had space to mention in this post). If you're interested in reading more, a sample chapter is available here.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Sorry there hasn't been a post here for awhile. This week I just have a few random links—but hopefully some interesting ones—but I'm planning what should be a very interesting book review for my next post.\nOne of my previous posts was referenced on a site called \"Node Generative Architecture\", which seems to be about the algorithmic design of features for virtual reality environments:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/nodegenerativearchitecture/036-implementing-conways-game-of-life-via-spreadsheet-csv-link-into-cad\nI recently read an interesting article about the Maria Theresa Thaler (MTT), a silver coin bearing the image of a Habsburg Empress:\nThe Ottoman authorities did not encourage use of the MTT, but their own silver coinage, the mejidiye, was generally regarded as inferior. The fact that soldiers and others in Ottoman service received payments in mejidiye by weight rather than by count meant that clipped and damaged coins were still acceptable, and this, as well as shortages of supply, debased the currency. As Ottoman debt piled up, their mints decreased the silver content of the coins: Both the central treasury and provincial pashas took in \"good\" money—coins with a high silver content—melted them down and alloyed them, then minted new coins with the same nominal value but a lower silver content. The acceptability of Turkish specie coins was thus further undermined. By the mid-19th century, the Maria Theresa thaler had become the monetary standard in the Levant, where it remained legal tender until 1960. [emphasis added]\nI find it a bit incredible that a coin bearing the date 1780 (though it has been minted regularly since then, even in the new millennium) and originating in the defunct Austro-Hungarian empire could circulate for so long and so widely (I've previously read of it being used in Yemen).\nI haven't done much with 3D printing recently myself, but I saw this \"digital sundial\" that is too cool not to share:\nAnother thing I've noticed recently is that a number of music videos I've watched on YouTube have over half a billion views. So I decided to investigate how common that is. According to this list on Wikipedia, there are now twenty-five videos with over 1 billion views. The most-viewed video, and the first to cross the 1 billion and 2 billion view thresholds, is Gangnam Style, while other videos with over 1 billion views are mainly English-language music videos—except for Bailando by Enrique Iglesias, which I hadn't come across before but is pretty great, and a Russian children's cartoon.\nAll the videos on this playlist of the top 500 videos on YouTube have over 200 million views. I used the rankings and the view counts to come up with the following graph. Assuming they follow a power law distribution (the book The Signal and the Noise that I've reviewed before discusses power law distributions applied to the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes and terrorist attacks), I estimate there are on the order of 10 million videos with over a million views.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Quite a bit closer to home than what I've been writing about recently, this post is about some kayaking I did last weekend.\nI went out to French Lake and Portobello Creek. The launch point I used was by the bridge over the throughfare between French Lake and Maquapit Lake. I didn't track my route on GPS, but from measuring it on the map when I got home (see below), I think I did a loop that was around 12 km. From the map, some of the places that I paddled look like they'd be meadows (rather than covered by a metre or more of water) at other times of the year.\nHere are a few photos from this kayaking trip:\nPortobello Creek is a protected wildlife area. Here is an introductory description, from one of the links above:\nPortobello Creek National Wildlife Area (NWA) is part of a large alluvial floodplain located adjacent to the St. John River just east of Fredericton, New Brunswick. Each spring the river overflows its banks submerging all but the highest forested area which makes it one of the most expansive wetland complexes in the Maritimes. The NWA further protects 37 provincially rare plant species.\nIt would be interesting to return at other times of year to see how it changes as the water level falls and rises seasonally, or try to get further up the creek. A canoe or kayak is one of the best ways to explore this kind of floodplain ecosystem.\nPermalink",

    "content": "My trip to France this spring ended in Toulouse, and so will this series. (See previous entries here, here, and here).\nToulouse was distinct from other places in France that I visited in a couple of prominent ways: a lot of the buildings are made of brick (giving the city its nickname 'la ville rose') and its proximity to Spain meant that there were lots of restaurants with tapas or pintxos on the menu. Yum! Another interesting feature was the presence of the Occitan language on some street signs and in a few specialty bookstores.\nOne of the features of Toulouse is the Canal du Midi. Built in the 17th century, it was one of the great engineering projects of its day. It begins in Toulouse, and stretches over 200 km to the Mediterranean; the Garonne River flows the other direction to the Atlantic Ocean at Bordeaux. Actually, three canals (Canal du Midi, the Garonne Lateral Canal, and the short Brienne canal linking to the Garonne River) meet at a basin/canal port in Toulouse, with arched openings to each one. The Canal du Midi is lined with stately plane trees, that are sadly at risk to a fungal infection. They stabilize the banks and shade the canal to reduce evaporation.\nWhile I was in Toulouse, I went walking and biking along the banks of the canals. I also went on a boat tour that passed through a few locks and described some of the buildings near the canal. The tour was included with a tourist pass for the city.\nWith the tourist pass, I went to three art galleries. The Musee des Augustins is housed in an old monastery. It was worth a visit just to see the cloister and chapel. The museum's collection included a lot of sculptures (they had an entire room dedicated to column capitals), but also some nice paintings. This picture shows a row of gargoyles that were displayed in an arcade of the cloister.\nThe Chateau d'Eau gallery is dedicated to photography. When I visited, one of the shows being exhibited was by Paola de Pietri. It had some truly fantastic landscapes from the Alps, that were metre-high contrasts of rock, vegetation, and snow.\nThe other gallery I went to, Les Abattoirs, didn't really appeal to me. It was filled with the kind of modern art that feels like it's trying too hard. For example, a couple of the pieces that I actually did like were painted with dirt (by Antoni Tàpies). I'm glad I had a tourist pass, because I didn't feel like it was a waste of money to leave after only a short visit.\nThe brick architecture in Toulouse extends to the churches in the city. This is the main cathedral of Toulouse (St-Etienne), which has an interesting asymmetric front.\nAnother significant church building in Toulouse is the St-Sernin Basilica. It is considered a prime example of Romanesque architecture. It is on the Camino Santiago pilgrimage route.\nI also visited the Eglise des Jacobins, a church and cloister of the Dominican order (confusingly, also known in France as Jacobins). I'd heard that the ceiling inspired Salvador Dali for the background of his painting Santiago El Grande—I can definitely see some resemblance. The church is also the resting place of the earthly remains of St. Thomas Aquinas; the cloister has some interpretative displays on the Dominicans.\nWhile I was in Toulouse, I attended a concert by an artist from Montreal: Coeur de Pirate (at Le Bikini). There was a large crowd that seemed to know most of her French songs. It was fun.\nToulouse has lots of outdoor markets in different places on different days of the week (and some indoor food markets that are open most days, I think). I also noticed that it has tonnes of bookstores. One of the parks I went to had a nice Japanese garden. All in all, it was a very pleasant place to visit.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Continuing my short series about my recent trip to France, this week's post is about the time I was in Marseille.\nMarseille is a very cool city, centered around a large harbour. The harbour entrance is flanked by forts, and numerous vantage points (Palais du Pharo, Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica, and the forts themselves) offer nice views of the city centre and out to sea. It's also a very old city, dating back to at least the time when the Greeks were masters of the Mediterranean. Its proximity to Italy and Corsica contributes to the dining choices—I had an excellent anchovy pizza while I was there. Shops around the harbour and the Panier district are full of local/Provençal products such as olive oil, soap, and lavendar.\nMarseille has a number of museums, but I only had time for one of them on this visit: MuCEM—the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations. It is pictured on the left in the following photo (the Villa Mediterranean is on the right). The architecture of MuCEM is very interesting, with the most prominent feature being the screening lattice-work made of fibre-reinforced concrete. The museum grounds also encompass Fort St-Jean, part of which was originally built by the Knights Hospitaller. Its roof has some gardens and great views of Marseille.\nInside the museum, the permanent exhibition covered the history of Mediterranean civilization. It was split into four thematic zones on four \"Mediterranean distinctives\": agriculture (specifically of the triad of wheat, olives, and grapes, supplemented with some sheep and goat raising), monotheism, citizenship, and the age of exploration. I found it to be very well organized and interpreted. There was also a temporary exhibition on Algeria before, during, and after French rule. It featured lots of old maps, and also some paintings (especially of the French conquest), and posters recruiting colonists. At the time of Algerian independence, the descendants of the colonists numbered around one million.\nWhile I was in Marseille, I also took the opportunity to do a short hike in the Calanques National Park. It was very accessible—I started at the endpoint of bus route 19 and hiked to Callelongue, then walked back along the seaside road—but it was quite a strenuous hike, reaching the summit of Béouveyre (≈ 360 m). The scenery in the park was nothing short of incredible, as the following photos hint at. I encountered a few other groups of hikers, but mostly it felt like I had the place to myself. I'm glad I was there early in April, as the weather wasn't too hot, which made the hiking less tiring.\nThe Calanques National Park is definitely a place I'd like to see again. In addition to doing more hiking, I'd love to go sea-kayaking along the coast there, which is riddled with tiny inlets. There were also boat tours of the Calanques (and/or the islands just offshore from the city) that departed right from Marseille harbour.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This is my second post about my recent trip to France. Last week I wrote about my time in Paris. This week's post is about Dijon and Lyon.\nDijon has a fantastic pedestrianized downtown. It has lots of specialty boutiques, especially food related. There are a couple of shops dedicated to mustard, as one would expect, many wine stores (Dijon is the capital of Burgundy), and I even saw a shop dedicated to truffles. Following a self-guided walking tour (marked with the symbol of an owl), I was met with fantastic architecture around every turn. One distinctive element of the architecture was \"toits Bourgogne\", steeply-pitched roofs with coloured tiles in geometric patterns. I got the impression that Dijon was one of the richest places in the world five hundred years ago. I don't know if that is literally true, but the dukes of Burgundy were some of the highest ranking nobility in France.\nHere are some photos from Dijon:\nA charcuterie and cheese platter I ate one night:\nWhile I was in Dijon, I rented a car for a day and drove south through the Cote de Nuits wine region to the walled town of Beaune. The drive and the town were very pretty. I saw some workers in the vineyards burning discarded branches.\nThis is the Clos Vougeot chateau. It was established over 900 years ago by Cistercian monks (my drive also took me to Citeaux Abbey, which I plan to write more about later).\nAfter Dijon, I went on to Lyon. I liked that city, but it seemed the most similar to Paris of all of the cities in France that I visited (similar architecture, promenades along the river banks) so it didn't stand out as much. If I had stayed longer, I expect I could have found events to attend and ways to get into the local routine and gotten a better feel for the place that way (I have a similar impression from Portland, Oregon).\nThe cathedral on top of Fourviere hill (near a Roman amphitheatre) was one of my favourites in France. From the stations of the cross around the courtyard, to the white stone exterior, to the colourful interior (stained glass, paintings, and mosaics!), to the view from its plateau, it was wonderful.\nThe city of Lyon straddles the Saône and Rhône rivers. (Incidentally, I learned recently that the circonflexe accent can indicate letters that were omitted when spellings were updated). Along the left bank of the Rhone, there is a string of barges (peniches) with bars on them. The river banks also have biking/running paths.\nAt the confluence of the Saône and Rhône there is a district that has been recently redeveloped and has a lot of ultra-contemporary architecture. A convenient boat bus runs down the Saone from the older parts of Lyon.\nI went to the Beaux-Arts museum in Lyon. One of the things I saw there was this sculpture of Leda and the swan which made me think of Orphan Black. There are a lot of classical references I don't get and I don't always know how to respond to nudes in art, but I liked this piece.\nIn Dijon and Lyon (and France in general), I enjoyed eating a variety of cheeses—and being a bit amazed at how affordable they were. The main ones that I recall trying are:\nBoth Dijon and Lyon are places I'd be happy to visit again. I didn't go to any museums or art galleries in Dijon this time (I had just come from Paris, where I did a lot of that sort of thing, and I was only there for a couple of days), but I think it had a few that may be worth a visit. Really there is no shortage of things to see and do in Dijon, which is really impressive considering it has a population of only about a tenth as many people as most of the other cities in France I visited. Biking around Burgundy also seems like it would be really fun.\nNot too far from Lyon, the town of St. Etienne is known as a creative design centre; and there are some interesting historic sites in and around the city of Besancon which is near Dijon. So there are plenty of reasons to visit the area.\nFinally, here is a picture of the hotel I stayed at in Dijon. It is located in a former Dominican monastery. I'm currently reading a book on religious orders, so I decided to save discussing the abbeys and cloisters I visited on this trip for a future post.\nPermalink",

    "content": "A month ago, I was in the middle of a two-week trip to France. I had a great time there, and plan to write a series of posts about it, starting with this one about my time in Paris.\nMuseums weren't the only thing I saw in Paris, but they provide more than enough content for a post. I also got to marvel at Notre Dame, enjoy the view from Sacre-Coeur, see the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe (although I didn't ascend either one), and of course enjoy some good food. Just walking along the Seine was fun in itself—I loved the fact that some people had gardens on their boats.\nOn of the first things I did when I got to Paris—before even leaving CDG airport—was to purchase a museum pass. Not only did this pass provide admission to a huge number of museums in Paris, along with access to expedited queues at some of them, it also made me willing to check out some places that I probably wouldn't have if I had to buy a separate ticket. For example, I spontaneously decided to go into the archaeological crypt under the plaza in front of Notre Dame; I was glad I did, as it had interesting excavations and renderings of Roman-era Paris. I also went into the Pantheon, while I probably would have only admired it from the outside if I had had to buy a separate ticket since I was headed to another part of the city and didn't want to take up too much time there. But having a quick visit was worthwhile.\nI went to nine museums/art galleries while I was in Paris, and that only scratches the surface of the cultural riches of that city. My top five favourites were:\nWhich is not at all to say that I didn't enjoy the others:\nWell, Picasso is not my favourite artist, so the museum dedicated to his works didn't especially appeal to me, but I can certainly recommend the others.\nIn the following paragraphs and photos, I'll try to describe some of the things I appreciated about and learned from these museums I visited. I took the typical tourist photos of the glass pyramid entrance to the Louvre and the central gallery of the d'Orsay, but I've tried to share a perspective that's a bit more unique.\nMany of these museums not only had fantastic collections, but fantastic spaces, too. This was notable in the Arts et Métiers museum, which is one of the oldest science and technology museums in the world. Part of the museum was formerly a church building and includes a Foucault pendulum (which demonstrates thte earth's rotation by its precession) swinging in the chancel. This museum also included a lot of original scientific apparatuses such as Antoine Lavoisier's laboratory. And also sextants and astrolabes, which I think are very cool. Other artifacts and models illustrated subjects like materials, energy, mechanics, and construction.\nThe Centre Pompidou was a very different kind of space: modern instead of classical in its architecture. The best feature of the building is the views it offers over Paris. In terms of art galleries, I liked the collections of the Louvre and d'Orsay better, but still found some paintings that I appreciated.\nAs someone who works in the field of wastewater treatment, I couldn't pass up a chance to visit the sewers of Paris. There is a short section of the sewer tunnels that is open to the public and has signs on the history of water supply and wastewater removal in Paris. It even includes a mural of Jean Valjean!\nhttp://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71499/Musee-des-egouts-de-Paris\nThe Musée national du Moyen Âge was very deserving of a visit. It's in an building that comprises a great house belonging to the monastic order of Cluny coupled with an ancient Roman baths. The collection includes a lot of religious art, a series of unicorn tapestries, and other medieval artifacts.\nThe Musée d'Orsay was probably my favourite art gallery on this trip (the Louvre was great as well, but more overwhelming). It is housed in a majestic old train station across the river from the Louvre.\nHere is one of the galleries in the d'Orsay, dedicated to the Orientalism movement:\nI found the Institut du monde arabe museum fascinating. It offered a perspective that there is more to the Arab world than the Islam that is so often in the news these days. They displayed pre-Islamic artifacts from ancient Yemen (such as the statue below from Qataban (just south of Saba'/Sheba), Sabaen/Himyaritic inscriptions, and sculptures from Palmyra early in the first millennium). Other items on display included nomadic accessories such as camel saddles, nice tiles, astrolabes, calligraphy utensils,* and scriptures and worship accessories (Muslim, Christian, and Jewish).\n* tiles, astrolabes, and calligraphy are all things I think are very cool.\nAt the renowned Louvre, I spent half a day and there were still entire wings I barely touched. Some things that especially impressed me at that museum were a mosaic floor from a church in Lebanon (laid out where it could be viewed from a balcony and from floor level) and a long grand hall of large renaissance paintings.\nAt the Louvre and Musée d'Orsay, there is definitely too much to see in a single visit. Having wondered around each of them to get a feel for what's there, if I ever get a chance to go back, I think it would be interesting to follow one of their suggested self-guided thematic tours: see here and here.\nIn addition to the museums that I visited on this trip, there are others that I'm now aware of that I might keep in mind for any future visits. These include art at the Orangerie, maybe the Grand or Petit Palais, non-Western works at the quai Branly, and a house dedicated to the paintings of Eugene Delacroix. Besides art, there is the natural history museum, the city of science and industry, various history and military museums, and the palace of Versailles and other sites around Paris.\nPermalink",

    "content": "This post is a collection of a few links related to the Saint John River.\nFirst of all, Canoe Kayak New Brunswick, which I'm pleased to be involved with, has a great new website. Take a look!\nA related thing of interest is this quest to paddle 1500 miles on a route that includes the entire length of the Saint John River in New Brunswick, along with the Allagash in Maine. I supported the expedition on GoFundMe.\nI recently read a very nice profile of the previous lieutenant-governor, Graydon Nicholas. It uses a photo from a previous post of mine.\nThe main topic of this post is a PhD thesis from UNB that examines some of the history of the Saint John River (download it here). It is titled River of three peoples: an environmental and cultural history of the Wәlastәw / riviѐre St. Jean / St. John River, c. 1550 – 1850 and was written by Dr. Jason Hall. At 465 pages in length, I haven't read the whole thing, but the parts I did read were very interesting. I don't think I've seen so much detail on 17th century New Brunswick history assembled elsewhere—granted I haven't really read scholarly research on the topic.\nHere is the beginning of the abstract:\nThis study investigates how three distinct cultures – Maliseet, French, and British – engaged with and transformed the ecology of the Welastekw/riviere St. Jean/St. John River, the largest river system in the Maritimes and New England. Ranging three centuries, ca. 1550‐1850, it examines cultural interactions relative to the river’s fish, banks, and flow to assess ecological changes. By developing comparisons among Maliseet, French, and British relationships to the river, it analyzes how cultural groups modified and expanded on the ecology of other peoples. Drawing upon a vast array of sources, including Maliseet oral traditions and language, archaeological surveys, scientific studies, historic maps and paintings, as well as diaries, letters, and reports of the waterway and its banks, this research makes significant contributions to a number of scholarly fields: river ecologies and human adaptations of them, Maliseet history, seigneurial settlement in colonial societies, Loyalist ecology, colonial and municipal legal history, historical cartography, and the role of ecological knowledge in governance and environmental activism. Moreover, it contributes to early modern North American environmental history, as well as global studies of rivers. (p. ii)\nThe author challenges the view that the region was untouched wilderness when European explorers and settlers arrived:\nAs humans have been an intrinsic part of this region since the retreat of the ice shield 13,000 years ago, it is impossible to consider the ecology of the Welastekw, riviere St. Jean, and St. John River, as the animal and plant dynamic within landscapes without people. As we have no evidence of humans in this landscape before the retreat of the last ice age and the formation of the river, it is an excellent place to examine the relationship between nature and culture that has been so fraught with debate since European colonization. From the 19th century onward, the trend in natural sciences has been to view nature as separate from humanity. In local environments such as the St. John River Valley, however, it is difficult to distinguish between nature and society. This study examines human interactions with the landscapes and waterscapes of the St. John watershed to analyze how three different human cultures interacted with the same physical environment over three centuries. (p.11)\nFrequent mention was made in the thesis of portage routes connecting the Saint John River to other watersheds, including the Saint Lawrence via Lac Temiscouata.\nAlmost all of the St. John’s principal tributaries connect to a host of other watersheds via short portages, which made the river an important link in a water‐based regional transportation network for lightweight canoe technology (p. 3)\nFort Nashwaak was discussed quite a bit, including Maliseet negotiations for better trade terms in 1695 (following a plague in 1694) and the brief siege in 1696, and the advantages and disadvantages of being located so far upriver: it was easier to defend, but left much of the desirable farmland downriver unprotected.\nThe Saint John River was a vital transportation route in the province, along with being a source of fish and replenishing soil nutrients during flooding. But it also brought challenges:\nThe St. John was a far larger river than what most [British] colonists had seen or grown accustomed to further south. Moreover, it behaved differently than the other rivers they had known. Its mouth was more complex and dangerous to navigate than most rivers in eastern North America or Great Britain. Its tidal estuary was longer than many waterways and some of the most powerful tides in the world influenced its flow 140 kilometers into the interior. The river and its tributaries also experienced more cold, snow, and ice buildup than rivers in New England and the British Isles. These factors limited settlers’ navigation and agricultural opportunities in ways that they did not foresee. (p.271)\nBritish settlers had to adapt norms around property rights to suit islands and flood plains that were seasonally flooded and where permanent fences could not be built.\nReversing Falls also figures prominently in this telling of the history of the river. The entire discharge of the river has to pass through a bottle neck that is less than 100 metres wide and is only passable for something like 40 minutes every 6 hours at slack tide. This limited navigation into the interior, especially for people unfamiliar with the area such as military raids without local guides. However, later on it also became a hurdle for upstream industry.\nThis thesis had some nice maps and paintings, but it would have been nice to see more figures. It seems like it has a pretty comprehensive bibliography, including many primary sources.\nFinally, it's not exactly related to the Saint John River, but I also wanted to share this refugee orientation video.\nPermalink",

    "content": "I just got back from vacation, which is why I haven't had a post for a while. I plan to write some posts about my trip, but first I wanted to share this, since it is well-suited for this time of year.\nIn a paper titled \"Influence of ocean-atmospheric oscillations on lake ice phenology in eastern North America\" Doctors Patterson and Swindles investigated ice out dates for a number of lakes in New Brunswick, Maine, and New Hampshire.\nPhenology is the \"study of changes in the date of recurring natural phenomena\".\nIn their introduction, they explain,\nThe annual dates in the spring when winter ice cover leaves a lake has come to be known as “ice out” (Hodgkins 2013).\nIce out is also sometimes referred to as “ice off” (e.g. Ghanbari et al. 2009) or “ice break up” (e.g. Sharma and Magnuson 2014). Ice out records are more valuable than\nice formation records as the breakup and disappearance of ice from a lake in the spring can occur very quickly (< 24 h), whereas fall freeze-up may take many days, and may be punctuated by several freeze–thaw cycles before ice finally settles in for the winter (Robertson et al. 1992).\nIce out dates for lakes correlate most strongly with local, late winter air temperatures and thus provide an important quantitative and annually-resolved source of hydrologic data for late-winter/early-spring climate change (Futter 2003; Hodgkins 2010; Hodgkins et al. 2002; Livingstone and Adrian 2009; Shuter et al. 2013). These data have been compiled primarily by amateur citizen scientists for a variety of purposes, including determining fishing seasons, estimating the spring opening of ferry boat routes, community contests, and general curiosity (Futter 2003; Hodgkins et al. 2002). Many ice out records extend well back into the nineteenth century, and are spread throughout the northern hemisphere (e.g. Magnuson et al. 2005). As such these records provide an important proxy for late-winter/early-spring climate in eastern North America, which extends beyond data available\nfrom instrumental climate stations.\nThey cite previous research stating that the ice cover season has been shortening by 0.6 days per decade. In the current research, they looked at correlations between ice out dates and March–April temperature records, as well as between lakes. They found that,\nAll lakes in this dataset have trended toward earlier ice out dates, although there have been decadal-scale reversals\nin the tendency to later ice out dates. ... After accounting for the considerable variation in absolute ice out dates between lakes, primarily related to climate variation associated with distance from the coast and elevation, there\nis a strong coherence in the pattern of ice out across all lakes.\nThey also used spectral analysis to look at periodicity in ice out dates. They tried to relate the periodicity to known cycles such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).\nI liked some of the figures the authors used to present their results. I also appreciated this note in the Acknowledgments: \"We also thank the generations of citizen scientists who collected the ice out data for all the lakes used in this study.\"\nI've done similar analyses before, so I thought I'd take one of the lakes they looked at (nearby Oromocto Lake) and do some statistical calculation of my own:\nHere are my comments and observations:\nPermalink",

    "content": "One of my goals for this year was to try eating crickets (I've mentioned in a previous post how it could be an emerging trend). On a recent trip to the US, I got a chance to do it.\nI bought a couple of Chapul bars from Chamberlin's Natural Foods in Kissimmee, Florida:\nFor the taste, I'd agree with this description from a Canadian cricket farm. The bars had dates as their first ingredient, so they provided most of the texture. The crickets were added in the form of a powder/flour—not whole—as the third or fourth ingredient. So their earthy taste came through, but didn't overwhelm the other flavours. I found the \"Aztec\" flavour was more interesting (just a bit spicy due to the cayenne powder used; it also had cocoa and coffee in the ingredients, but those flavours were pretty subtle), but the \"Chaco\" bar is more like a typical energy bar (with peanuts as a main ingredient; it had higher protein, fat, and calories than the former). The names for these bars come from pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas. Chapul also has Asian-inspired flavours, but I haven't tried any of them yet.\nAcheta domestica crickets are raised to provide a source of protein in these bars and other products.\nThe packaging carries this rationale for farming and eating insects:\nWhy eat crickets?\nIn a changing world, our diets will dictate our destiny.\nCrickets need only 17% of the food, and less than 1% of the water and land resources than livestock for the same amount of protein. They also require fewer natural resources than meat substitutes like soy, corn and rice.\nAt Chapul, we're creating solutions towards a healthier, more sustainable food supply. Chapul Cricket Protein Powder is a sustainable, ancient protein source that we've crafted into a gourmet energy bar to fuel your adventures.\nWe invite you to expand your mind, expand your taste and join us in a food revolution.\nApparently, edible insects have yet to take-off in Canada, though.\nPermalink",

    "content": "Last weekend I read the book New Brunswick: A Short History by Timothy Frink. It's a very quick read, but I still found it informative. Recently I was complaining with some friends about how history is taught in our schools and this book just drove home the point that there's a lot of interesting things that happened in this region over the past 500 years that I certainly don't remember in the curriculum. Right in the introduction, the author makes the point that for centuries, this area was on the front lines (occasionally literally so) between Natives and Europeans, French and English (even French and French at times), British and Americans. One downside to the book is that it is very Saint John-centric.\nAs I was reading, I made a list of some of the key events and developments in NB history that the author mentions. I've put them together in a timeline graphic for reference (Colour doesn't mean anything, it's just to make the text more readable).\nThe book also had some discussion of the railroad and transportation history of the Province, which resonates with some current developments.\nWith rates as low as fifty percent of their competitors, the I.C.R. [Intercolonial Railroad, from Halifax to Quebec City via the North Shore of NB] was still able to show a profit; so some sort of remedial action was inevitable. In 1919, the I.C.R. was engulfed by an emerging national system. It was renamed the Canadian National Railway; its head office was moved from Moncton to Toronto; and to the best of anyone's knowledge, it has never made money since.\nThe freight rates were increased to central Canadian levels immediately; and then again by a further forty percent to pay for the new system's mind-numbing debt load. The effect on New Brunswick's industry was ruinous.\nIn 1883, the Canadian Pacific opened their 'short line' that ran from Saint John, through northern Maine, to Montreal, thus giving the port of Saint John the theoretical advantage of being served by both national rail systems. In practice, the two giants viewed competition as a very nasty word, and it never made the slightest difference. ... C.P. said they never made any money either. Much of the 'short line' has recently [this book was written in 1997] been bought by the Irving group, who are operating it under the name of the Southern New Brunswick Railway, which will make money.\n(pp. 103 – 104)\nPermalink",

    "content": "Although my statistics skills are stronger now and I probably would do some things differently now, I still like this analysis I did back in 2010 on some publically-available data on countries around the world. I wrote it on Facebook then a former classmate from UNB who works in the field of International Development posted it on his blog with some additional comments.\nCheck it out: http://barefooteconomics.ca/2010/08/16/guest-post-the-world-by-numbers/\nHere's an excerpt of my conclusions:\nThis analysis doesn’t prove anything, as I was only checking for correlations. However, it is suggestive of some things, such as the link between [a lack of] corruption, property rights, and GDP; and the role that free communication has in securing other freedoms. The emergence of expected correlations, such as the ones between civil rights and political freedoms, or between water and sanitation access, or between internet and cell phone usage, suggest that this analysis probably has some validity. Finally, I’d like everyone to realize that there is a wealth of data freely available and interesting patterns can show up if we take the time to look.\nOwen's blog is definitely worth browsing around while you're over there.\nPermalink",

    "content": "For my first regular post (I plan to normally publish on a weekly basis, probably on Thursdays), I decided to look back at the research I did for my master's degree at the NSERC Chair in Water Treatment at the University of Waterloo. Two years ago, I submitted my thesis, titled,\nAn Investigation of Nitrification Predictors and Factors in Two Full-Scale Drinking Water Distribution Systems\nAs a brief explanation, most drinking water utilities in North America add a persistent disinfectant chemical so that the water is protected from harmful bacteria all the way to the tap. Chlorine has traditionally been the disinfectant of choice. However, many utilities are now choosing chloramines (mono-, di-, tri-), made from reacting free chlorine with ammonia. Chloramines have some notable advantages, such as often being longer-lasting in distribution system environments and not producing as much byproducts (at least not as many tri-halomethanes). One downside they have is that when they decay, ammonia is released; ammonia is a food source for some microorganisms so under some circumstances chloramines can promote the growth of microorganisms in distribution systems—the opposite of a disinfectant's purpose. The microbial conversion of ammonia to nitrite, and subsequently nitrate, is known as nitrification and is something that distribution system operators want to avoid/minimize. I'm deliberately using the term \"microorganisms\" rather than simply \"bacteria\", because there is another kind of microorganism, archaea that can be involved; this was an aspect of my research.\nNot counting literature review, there were three main parts to my thesis research:\nIf you'd like to see a copy, here are links for:\nI also presented about my research at the 46th CENTRAL Canadian Symposium on Water Quality.\nPermalink",

My thesis topic for my Master's degree was \"Nitrification in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems\". Now I'm working for ADI Systems in the field of industrial wastewater treatment.\nAside from professional topics, I'm interested in travel, making stuff (e.g. woodworking—although my skills are very modest compared to some of my family members—and 3D printing), and all kinds of science, math, and technology. I'm fascinated by emergent phenomenon and certain facets of history. Languages are another interest of mine, although English is the only one I really speak; I've studied French in grade school, taken some Arabic courses in university, had some house-mates teach me the Korean alphabet, and picked up a few Spanish phrases from travelling. I appreciate experiencing other cultures—especially the foods! Some of the Psalms in the Bible speak to me like little else. Outdoors, I enjoy hiking, camping, biking, and kayaking (or any kind of boating). Expect any or all of these topics to appear from time to time on this blog.\nIf you want to get in touch with me, you can do so via LinkedIn.",

My goals are to hone my creative skills and share some ideas that I hope readers will find interesting or useful.\nSome of what I plan to publish will be semi-related to what I do professionally—information and discussion on water science and issues, ranging from the accessible to highly technical. Some material will probably relate to other areas of science and engineering. Other topics may include reviews of books and movies, notes on travel and world affairs, 3D printing tips and tricks, mathematic/statistical computation, cars, games, and more.\nTo start with, I'll be re-publishing some content that I've previously shared on Facebook or other forums.\nA couple of final notes:\nHappy reading!",
